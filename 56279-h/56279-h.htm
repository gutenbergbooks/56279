<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we compare Christianity with the other dogmatic
religions of the world, we are at once struck
by a feature peculiar to it, namely, the complexity
of its doctrinal system. A glance at the Athanasian
Creed is sufficient to show that this peculiarity
results from the existence of fundamental inconsistencies
in the dogmas of Christianity. Such
inconsistencies are not found in other religions,
whether, like Mohammedanism, they have at once
sprung into full maturity at the time of their
creation, or whether, like Judaism, they have passed
through a long and slow process of development.
The inconsistencies of Christian doctrine clearly
cannot be ascribed to the necessary tendencies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the evolution of dogmatic religion; they must be
due to special circumstances connected with the
history of Christianity.</p>

<p>What these circumstances were there is no
difficulty in ascertaining. The fully developed
dogmatic system of Christianity is the product of
the union of two opposite streams of religious
tendency. From the collision of the monotheism
of Judaism with the polytheism of Paganism the
inconsistencies of its doctrines have sprung. In
the doctrine of the Trinity, which takes up so
much of the Athanasian Creed, we have the clearest
evidence of this. But, in reality, the whole of
Christianity is pervaded by the contradictions
inseparable from the combination in it of the
characteristics of monotheistic and polytheistic
religion. This combination is the source of its
unique power; it thus can satisfy both the higher
and the lower class of religious instincts; but its
complex and confused theology is also an inevitable
result.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of the doctrinal system
of Christianity can thus be readily explained by
a reference to the conditions of its origin. To
investigate in detail, by the same method of historical
inquiry, the causes which produced its
separate dogmas, is the object of this essay. The
origin of the earlier ones must be traced through
the history of Judaism; the later ones were Pagan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
but they were grafted on a Jewish stock. Starting
from primary religious ideas, we have to examine
the growth and modification of theological dogma.
Our study, accordingly, will take us over the whole
period of history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<small>THE FOUNDATION OF MONOTHEISM.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of the birth of Christianity, only in
one portion of the Roman world could a new and
pure religion have arisen. The fusion of the
empire had, by destroying their national basis,
fatally weakened the Pagan religions; so far as
real feeling was concerned, they had passed into
the hands of the ignorant classes exclusively, and
had lost the vitality in which alone the higher
religious forces can germinate. Philosophies, resting
on a common basis of contempt of the popular
polytheism, were the refuge of the more enlightened.
Between philosophers and those who
still believed in the power of the ancient gods
there existed a vast mass of people who had
religious instincts with no sure means of satisfying
them, ripe subjects for the new religion which they
looked for but could not originate. At this time,
throughout the Pagan world, a high and systematic
morality could only be reared on an intel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>lectual
basis which destroyed sympathy with
common men; in no part of it could have been
developed the pure enthusiasm needed for the
founding of a great religion.</p>

<p>One region of the empire alone was free from
the symptoms of religious decay. In the small
district of Palestine, with many offshoots scattered
over the world, lived a people who professed a
religion of the purest type. And this religion was
not a lightly held philosophical theory; its adherents
clung to it with a passionate tenacity, and
were ever ready to face martyrdom in its defence.
It was a pure monotheism, and morality was
inculcated by it, indeed, maintained by it, in the
strongest and most effective fashion. With justice
Josephus could assert that Greek philosophers
only followed the example of his countrymen, and
taught doctrines which the Jewish sacred law
had made practical realities.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> For Judaism was
not an esoteric creed which only the more cultured
Jews fully understood; the lowest of the people
grasped its principles, abhorred the idea of polytheism,
detested even the smallest advance towards
idolatry, and regarded every sin as a violation of
divine decrees. Such a religion, pure and strongly
held, was fit to be the parent of a noble religious
system. In it originated the earliest doctrines of
the religion which now sprang from it and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>quered
the Roman world. And as Judaism was
in a special sense a national religion, its development
must be examined in the history of the
Jewish people.</p>

<p class="tb">We cannot, with any approach to historical
certainty, assert more respecting the social and
political condition of the first known ancestors of
the Jews, than that they belonged to a race of
nomad tribes wandering in the district which,
roughly speaking, lies between Egypt and Palestine.
In endeavouring to ascertain the religious ideas of
this race, we may safely assume that the character
of their religion was determined by the circumstances
of their position. Living in a region which
is either desert or barren and unprofitable land,
the softer influences of nature could not affect
them. The terror of nature would fascinate them;
lightning and tempest would speak to them of their
gods, and from the harshness of their surroundings
they would derive the gloomiest impressions of
the powers of the supernatural world. Their
religion would be essentially a religion of fear.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Having little to deify on the earth around them,
their mythology would be based on the phenomena
of the sky. Sun and moon and stars would be
their divinities, and to these they would ascribe
jealous and implacable tempers. This sternness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of their religion would carry with it many advantages.
Their deities would be more majestic, more
removed from themselves, than the gods of happier
peoples, and the humility they would feel in
worship would have within it the seeds of a higher
religious development. A still more important
feature of their mythology would be its narrowness.
The poverty of their environment would cause
their gods to be few and limited in number. No
fresh divinities would discredit the older ones and
reveal the weakness of their theology. And this
would be likely to produce a serious effect on the
outward form of their religion.</p>

<p>Whenever a common polytheism is professed by
peoples politically separate, there is a tendency
to localise deities. Now a large mythology throws
great difficulties in the way of this tendency. If
there are many gods, each one individually is too
unimportant to be the divinity of a people, and
the political divisions of course being few, after
every tribe or state has appropriated a deity, a
surplus is left with no particular duty to discharge.
When this occurs, it usually results that the national
deities are formed into a higher order of gods;
and probably divine oligarchies, like that of the
Hellenic mythology, are always created in this
manner. But it is obvious that if the number of
gods is small at the time of the formation of
political divisions, the process of localization is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
greatly facilitated. The fewer they are, the more
honour attaches to the gods individually; each
one is sufficiently dignified to become the god of
a separate people. After a system of this kind
has been fully developed, the gods form a federal
council, in which each state or tribe has a representative.
The quarrels and rivalries of the earthly
bodies are of course transferred to their heavenly
representatives; all local patriotism expresses itself
in the general religion.</p>

<p>From the evidence of the early records of the
Jewish people we may conclude that the race from
which they sprang went through a process of this
character. In these, Israel, whether as a tribe or
as a people, is often described as associating with
other tribes or peoples, and comparing its own god
with theirs, a common basis of religious belief
being assumed.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The god of Israel seems to be
regarded as superior to the other gods; but this
does not imply that distinctions of rank were
recognized in the common mythology. An intelligent
Englishman would hardly assert that his
country is now the chief European power; but if
any other state were named as a possible enemy,
he would probably say that his own was more
than a match for it. In the same way, patriotism
expressing itself in religion, the Israelites considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
their own god, or heavenly representative, more
than a match for any other, and this naturally involved
a belief in his superiority. From these
conditions a spurious monotheism would necessarily
result. In proportion as their patriotism was strong,
the Israelites would worship exclusively the tribal
god, though thoroughly believing in the existence of
others. This, of course, is only polytheism, but it
contains within it the possibility of monotheistic
development.</p>

<p>Such probably was the state of the religious
ideas of the Israelites at the time they came into
connection with Egypt. Previously they had been
one among many cognate tribes having a common
polytheistic mythology. In this mythology they
had a tribal god, whom they worshipped without
denying the existence of the rest. While mixing
and constantly coming into collision with other
tribes, each owning, of course, a similar deity, tribal
patriotism must have made them, for the most
part, devote themselves to this god exclusively.
When they arrived in Egypt, they found there a
system of religion utterly unlike their own, and
this would confirm them in adherence to it. Being
then a small tribe, they could more easily pay
strict allegiance to the tribal god. As they increased
in numbers, both through ordinary growth
and through receiving accessions from cognate
peoples outside, this allegiance would begin to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
endangered. While they were a small tribe often
meeting with other tribes which had different gods,
patriotism would make them cling to their own.
But when they became a large tribe, and ceased to
come in contact with other branches of their race,
not only would tendencies towards polytheism in
actual worship be strengthened, but the check upon
them in the shape of tribal patriotism would be
weakened. They would thus be likely to drift back
into the racial polytheism, their tribal god being
lost in the rest. The opposition to the Egyptian
religion<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> would rather help this tendency, as it
would throw them more on their feelings of race.
So, on the whole, it is probable that the Israelites,
during their connection with Egypt, became more
or less ordinary polytheists.</p>

<p>In one respect, however, their relations with
Egypt must have tended to maintain their adherence
to the tribal god. The period of struggle
against Egyptian power which preceded their departure
from Egypt must, by stimulating their
patriotism, have prevented the remembrance of his
old rank from being wholly lost. Patriotism could
not have been completely disassociated from the
divinity who had formerly been the centre round
which it rallied. The outburst of patriotic fervour
necessarily accompanying the actual conflict with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Egypt, as well as its ultimate success, must have
enormously increased the influence of the tribal
god. For a time, we may be sure, he regained his
original distinction, and became to the Israelites
the representative of heaven. During the first
serious fighting in Palestine, he would for the same
reason retain his power. But then, as the national
warfare degenerated into a series of detached
tribal contests, the old tendency towards polytheistic
worship would revive. To ascertain what
forces counteracted this tendency, we must consider
a new question.</p>

<p>Judaism may as well be said to have been
founded by Moses as Christianity by Christ. Even
if we knew nothing of its founder, there are features
of Christianity which we could only explain by
referring them to the influence of a personal character.
There are peculiarities of Judaism, too,
which have to be traced back to the personality
of its founder. Moses and Christ, indeed, are
inseparably connected in history. One completed
what the other began. Without Moses,
Christ could hardly have existed; without Christ,
the work of Moses would have been of little value
to the world. This presumption from internal
probability corroborates the traditional evidence,
and justifies us in accepting its general outline.</p>

<p>If the Israelites migrated from Egypt under the
leadership of Moses, and thus began their national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
life, it was very natural that he should be to some
extent their legislator as well. Their leader, under
such circumstances, must have had great ability,
and also enormous power. His ability, together
with his power, would lead him to consolidate the
energies of his people, in order to fit them for the
difficult task lying before them; and this could
only be done by a system of legislation. Accordingly,
we may assume that the foundation of the
Jewish law was laid by Moses, though it is very
hard to ascertain what that foundation actually was.
The ten commandments, in their simplest form, are
generally admitted to be relics of the Mosaic age.
To account for the first and most important of
these we have, in particular, to call in the authority
of Moses. “I am Jahveh thy god; thou shalt have
none other gods beside me,” is the foundation
stone of the development of monotheism. It implies
the existence of polytheism, but it decrees
that polytheism shall be abolished. If the people,
or any class of the people, continuously obeyed it,
they had in time to become pure monotheists. If
they ceased to think of other gods, these gods
would ultimately pass out of remembrance, and
Jahveh alone would occupy heaven. Jewish
monotheism, with all its wonderful consequences,
must be ascribed to the framer of the first commandment.</p>

<p>We have to assign its authorship to Moses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
because of the difficulty of otherwise accounting
for it. That it was a spontaneous decree of the
people, produced by their confidence in the national
god after their victory over the Egyptians, is very
improbable. Many reasons, however, can be given
for its having been decreed by Moses. The explanation
just mentioned is more probable when
applied to him. He may, as Professor Kuenen
conjectures,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> have regarded the national success as
a proof of the greatness of the national god, and
so have vowed the people to his exclusive service.
The connection between this hypothesis and the
idea of a covenant between Jahveh and Israel, to
be referred to presently, is in its favour. But a
stronger reason for believing the commandment to
be due to Moses might be found in his desire
to secure the national unity. The Israelites had
grown so numerous as to be divided into separate
tribes. If the people had more gods than one, the
old process would be repeated, each tribe choosing
a different god for its tribal deity; and thus their
religion would help the tendency towards disunion.
We know how the unity of Greece was anything
like a reality only when it was based on the
worship of Apollo at Delphi, Apollo becoming
practically the national god of the Hellenes.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> If
no rivals of Apollo had existed, how much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
effective his worship would have been! In general
it may be said that, in an early stage of political
development, national unity can be secured against
tribal separation only by basing it on religion. A
close union was specially necessary to the Israelites
at this time, when they had to struggle against so
many peoples in order to obtain a home. Recognizing
the impossibility of otherwise securing this
union, Moses may well have framed the first
commandment in order to give the tribes at least one
bond of union in the exclusive worship of Jahveh,
their national god.</p>

<p>We may conclude, then, that from the Mosaic
age it was part of the Israelitic religion that the
tribal, or national, god should be worshipped exclusively.
The people, whatever might be their
practice, had accepted the principle. The second
and third commandments, which prohibit idolatry
and the misuse of Jahveh’s name, are evidently
meant to be supports of the first, by demanding
reverence for Jahveh and by abolishing the records
of his rivals. The next two are merely local. But
the last five, the second table of the law, are the
basis of a feature of the Jewish religion even more
important than its monotheism.</p>

<p>That the morality of the time, so far as it existed,
should have been based on religion is natural
enough; and, accordingly, at first sight, there seems
to be nothing remarkable about the five moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
commandments. When examined closely they are
found more curious. The first four, though simple
rules which tribal experience might have shown to
be necessary, are still exceptional as the laws of a
half-civilized people. The last takes us into a
region of morality with which it is impossible that
the Israelites could then have been acquainted.
Only a highly civilized mind could have conceived
the precept, “Thou shalt not covet.” Here again
we are driven for explanation to the personality of
Moses.</p>

<p>These commandments are inexplicable as the
product of a low civilization, but they are very
natural if a high civilization be assumed as their
basis. Egypt was at this time highly civilized,
and, as we know from the “Book of the Dead,”
had developed a pure morality, with which the last
commandment would be thoroughly in harmony.
If we could assume that Moses once belonged to
the inner circle of Egyptian civilization, the
peculiarities of Judaism would be fully explained. The
early traditions represent him as brought up in the
king’s household, and, accordingly, in a position to
be acquainted with the best philosophy of the age.
A later tradition says he was “instructed in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> And probabilities are
distinctly in favour of this. The power and authority
he exercised over the Israelites could be readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
accounted for if he was a member of their tribe
who had received the highest education of the time.
Such a training must have developed his faculties,
and marked him out as the leader of his countrymen,
ensuring their reverence for him, and trust in
his ability to rule them.</p>

<p>In a region of historical inquiry like that in
which we are now moving, we must be content to
be guided by conjecture. When a conjecture
asserts what is intrinsically probable, and at the
same time explains a complex series of phenomena,
we may fairly consider it to be accurate.
The conjecture that Moses drew his inspiration
from the higher culture of Egypt is of this kind.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
There was nothing strange in his stamping the
principles of that culture, if he was acquainted
with it, on his Israelitic legislation. He had an
unequalled opportunity of realizing the ideals of
conduct. Political circumstances had placed the
destinies of his people in his hands. Commands
coming from him had an authority only possible
at the beginning of national life. It is thoroughly
in accordance with probability that he should have
seized the occasion offered him, and imposed laws
on the nation he ruled which, unless they passed
utterly out of remembrance, would ensure it a
noble development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>From the evidence of the ten commandments it
is thus almost certain that the Israelitic religion
was, even at its beginning, peculiarly moral. The
people were commanded to worship Jahveh exclusively,
and also to practise a severe morality.
From this connection between Jahvism and morality
important consequences were bound to follow.</p>

<p>All ancient religions were more or less marked
in practice by a sacrificial system. The idea at
the bottom of the custom of offering sacrifices is
very simple. Men, as a proof of their devotion,
give to their gods some of their possessions. The
immediate object may be either to win the divine
favour or to avert the divine wrath. When a religion
is harsh and severe, the latter is likely to be
the more frequent sacrificial motive. Accordingly,
when the Israelites sacrificed to Jahveh, it was
probably for the most part to remove Jahveh’s
anger, to obtain forgiveness for their sins against
him. Now exactly in proportion to the closeness
of the connection between Jahvism and morality
would be the tendency of these sins to be real sins.
When sins are included among offences against
a religious code, they are pretty sure to be the
offences most frequently committed. Hence it
follows that the early sacrificial system of the
orthodox Israelites must have been largely directed
to the atonement of sin.</p>

<p>If, then, we could accept the accounts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Pentateuch as an accurate description of the sacrificial
customs of the Mosaic age,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> with external
evidence corroborating internal probability, we
might regard our conclusion as proved. But, as
Professor Kuenen has shown, the whole system of
the Jewish ceremonial law described in the Pentateuch
was, in at least its final and consolidated
form, the result of the labours of the period of
Ezra and Nehemiah. It thus becomes a question
of great difficulty to determine what portion of the
law, if any, existed in early times. A few statements
of the prophets seem to imply that in the
Mosaic age no sacrifices at all were offered to
Jahveh.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> But the prophets cannot be considered
trustworthy authorities for the early history of
Israel. They wrote under the pressure of immediate
circumstances, and with a very definite purpose.
This purpose, as will afterwards be shown,
required them to cast discredit on sacrifices. In
doing so, their repeated references are evidence
that a full sacrificial system in connection with the
worship of Jahveh was established in their time.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Here their testimony is irrefragable, and it proves
that such a system must have begun before their
age. No period was so likely to have originated
it as the earliest, when the foundations of the
national life were laid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>But the strongest argument in favour of the
conclusion that sacrificing to Jahveh for the atonement
of sin began in the Mosaic age is, that thus
only can subsequent phenomena be explained.
The great point in the history of Jewish religion
is the magnificent period of the prophets. Their
writings are the noblest expression ever given to
religious and moral ideas. We explain their pure
monotheism by deducing it from the institution of
the first commandment, which necessitated in a
class obeying it continuously the ultimate development
of the belief that Jahveh was the one God
“that made the earth and created man upon it,
that stretched out the heavens and commanded all
their host.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> How can we explain their wonderful
morality except in the same way? We know from
the commandments that moral excellence was required
by the religion of Jahveh from the very first.
If thus from the beginning morality was impressed
on Jahveh’s worshippers by a sacrificial system
which declared every sin to be an offence against
him that must be expiated at a personal cost, we
can understand how any class continuously adhering
to him should in time have developed a
morality in which sin was hated for its own sake,
and goodness made the essence of religion. Such
vivid and constant evidence of Jahveh’s hatred of
sin would naturally, after many generations, pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>duce
the pure morality of the prophets. But
otherwise it is inexplicable. A mere theoretical
connection between Jahvism and morality might
ultimately have made the Jahvists better than the
worshippers of other gods, but it could not have
created that marvellous passion for righteousness
which made the Jewish religion at its best the
greatest the world has ever seen. This conclusion
does not involve the belief that in the Mosaic age
the system of sacrificing for sin was fully developed.
If the foundation of it was laid then, the conditions
of the problem are satisfied. The system
would ensure its own subsequent development.
Once Jahveh’s hatred of sin was marked by any
practical effect, as time went on, through the
moral growth of the people who grasped the
doctrine, that hatred would seem to deepen, to
become more comprehensive and complete. A
conclusion which explains so much, and has probability
so greatly in its favour, may fairly be
accepted.</p>

<p>If from the age of Moses the religion of Jahveh
was thus inseparably connected with morality, all
the best of the people would rally round it.
Unless Israel at any time was wholly without
a remnant that loved righteousness and hated
iniquity, Jahvism must always have had its earnest
supporters. The same cause, of course, would tend
to make it unpopular with the mass of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
But for this, it would be difficult to understand
why the Israelites, down to the captivity, were
so persistent in their devotion to strange gods.
Jahveh was their national divinity, and a mere love
of polytheism could hardly account for this incessant
desertion of him. The close connection
between Jahvism and morality fully explains the
phenomenon. The Israelites in general found
Jahveh too severe for them, and turned to gods
more tolerant of evil-doing, just as Catholic sovereigns
used to choose indulgent confessors. This
fact would only confirm the few more strongly in
their allegiance. The worshipper of Jahveh would
justly extol Jahveh in comparison with Baal, as he
compared himself with the worshipper of Baal.
And thus through the purity of Jahveh’s adherents
their religion would be saved from the contamination
of baser elements, and would necessarily
develop in simplicity and truth. Sin, at first hated
chiefly because Jahveh forbade it, would at last be
hated because of its own foulness; Jahveh, at first
reverenced merely as the national saviour, would
at last be reverenced as the lord of heaven and
earth. Down the channel of Jahvism flowed all
the higher forces of the national life, till at length
they broke forth in the wave of moral and religious
energy which finally overcame resistance in the
grand struggle of the prophets.</p>

<p>Though the majority of the people usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
worshipped other gods, and thus broke their own
sacred laws, we are not to suppose that they denied
Jahveh’s existence, or even his right to worship.
They must have been pure polytheists, believing
that many gods reigned in the heavens. Among
these they held it to be their right to choose, just
as a lower-class Catholic will choose his favourite
saint. But they fully admitted that Jahveh was
the national god; and in periods of danger, when
patriotism was strongly excited, it is likely that
for the moment they returned to the exclusive
worship of him. Thus the power of Jahvism over
the people at large would rise and fall with the
national fortunes. When Israel was prosperous,
Jahvism prospered too; when Israel declined,
Jahvism declined as well. For we may well believe
that the Israelites flourished just in proportion
as they were united. The book of Judges is
probably in the main historically correct. The
tribes would drift apart, or even quarrel with each
other, and their enemies would overcome them and
take their cities. Then a wave of patriotism
would sweep over them; they would reunite and
become victorious in their turn. From this it is
easy to see what credit Jahveh would in time
acquire, even among the entire people. Union
brought with it national happiness and success,
but the adoption of Jahvism was the condition of
union. So it would appear to them that by re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>turning
to Jahveh and observing the precepts of
their sacred law they could always secure prosperity.
When serving Jahveh faithfully, they
would have good fortune; after falling away from
him, they would quickly be plunged in calamity.
How soon this would create a conviction of
Jahveh’s irresistible power! In their misfortunes
they would see Jahveh punishing them for their
apostacy; in their successes they would see Jahveh
accepting their repentance and restoring his protection.</p>

<p>Thus in time all the people would in one sense
become Jahvists. They would believe that Jahveh
was their true god, and that they ought to worship
him alone. When they turned to other gods, they
would do so with a distinct consciousness of evil-doing
and a certain expectation of punishment.
Jahveh’s severity of moral requirement would
render it impossible for them to serve him
willingly; they could never become true Jahvists.
But in their hearts would always be a sullen fear
of Jahveh, a belief that he punished terribly.
This was the chord of popular feeling which the
prophets touched, and to the existence of which
they owed their success.</p>

<p>These conditions would naturally in time produce
the belief that a covenant had been concluded at
the beginning between Israel and Jahveh. The
true Jahvists would of course eagerly proclaim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
that Israel’s happiness depended on obedience to
Jahveh, that calamity was the result of his just
anger, and prosperity the consequence of his favour.
But that Jahveh should have given notice of this,
and shown the ways of good and evil from the
first, would soon seem to be necessary. Hence in
later times it would be thought that Jahveh had
formally concluded a covenant with the Israelites,
in which he engaged to protect them and make
them prosperous, on condition that they served
him and kept his law.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> All the failures and
misfortunes of the nation would be ascribed by
the Jahvists to the breaking of this covenant by the
people, and the consequent drawing down of the
penalties of its violation on their heads.</p>

<p>From the development in Jahvism of this idea
that suffering was a divine punishment followed
the most important results. If national suffering
was considered to be due to national breaking of
the law, equally private suffering would be ascribed
to private breaking of the law. Sin would be
looked on as the cause of suffering. Abstinence
from sin was commanded by Jahveh, and so every
sin would be a violation of his commands that
invited punishment by him. Private suffering
would then be regarded as the proof of sin, as
Job’s friends regarded it, and as the divine chastise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>ment
of it. But of course it would seem right
that the chastisement should be proportioned to
the sin, and limited for each offence. Thus, in
time, suffering would be considered the atonement
of sin, Jahveh’s punishment of it, after which his
favour would be restored. But sacrifices, as we
saw before, were the legal means of atoning for
sin. If a man sinned, then, in order to escape the
suffering which otherwise would be the penalty of
his sin, he would offer a sacrifice. Now Israelitic
sacrifices, as they were a pastoral people, were
mainly offerings of living beasts. Under these
circumstances there would certainly be a tendency
to imagine that the penalty of sin was laid on the
sacrificial victim, that its suffering and death were
accepted as the atonement in place of the suffering
of the offender.</p>

<p>Professor Kuenen, basing his opinion on the fact
that no direct mention of it occurs in the law,
believes that this idea of atonement by vicarious
suffering did not enter into the Jewish sacrificial
system.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The legal permission in certain cases of
a sin offering of meal or flour<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> supports his conclusion.
On the other hand, vicarious punishment
was clearly recognized in one great ceremony of the
law. The scapegoat is described as bearing away
the sins of the people into the wilderness in which
it was left to die.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> With a tendency of the sacri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>ficial
system towards the belief in vicarious punishment,
and clear evidence in one instance of its
recognition, we may safely assume that it entered
to some extent into the feelings of the people when
they sacrificed. Probably it was never consciously
developed in the law, and so it was not directly
mentioned, and, in exceptional cases, inanimate
offerings were allowed. But after the sacrificial
system had been long in existence, the constant
repetition of animal sacrifices would naturally
produce the belief. We find the principle of
vicarious punishment asserted in the prophets,
and fully developed in the sending away of the
scapegoat. We may safely conclude, then, that,
from the beginning, it was latent in Jahvism, and
gradually grew as Jahvism passed into Judaism,
until at length it reached maturity in the first
great dogma of Christianity.</p>

<p>Such a principle, growing in Jahvism, would
tend still more to develop a hatred of sin. Morality
exists because, from the simple observation of
social phenomena, sin is connected with suffering,
and calamity of some kind regarded as its inevitable
consequence. But this connection of sin with
suffering would be placed far more vividly before
the worshipper of Jahveh, as his religion gradually
forced on him the belief that “without shedding
of blood there is no remission.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In the blood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the victim sprinkled on Jahveh’s altar, the Israelite
would see stern evidence of the inexorable severity
of Jahveh against sin—a severity so great that he
could not forgive it without exacting the penalty,
though his mercy might allow the transgressor to
find a substitute. Harsh and cruel Jahvism thus
would be, even rooted in injustice; but in effect it
would be grandly moral, stamped with a condemnation
of sin that, at such a stage of civilization,
was of priceless value.</p>

<p>From the Mosaic age, then, on to the period of
the prophets, we can imagine the development of
Jahvism in Israel. There was always the nucleus
of true Jahvists, who observed the law so far as
it existed, and steadily grew in spirituality and
moral insight. They were the national party;
for them tribal divisions could have had but little
importance. From among them, in times when
the national fortunes were near ruin, always uprose
the deliverers, as the pure flame of their patriotism
drew to them the nobler elements of the people.
They, in fact, were Israel, a continuous power
representing the national life. Through a long
struggle, marked by many a martyrdom, they contended
against the downward tendencies of the
rest of the people, until at length, after the final
destruction of Israel’s material greatness, they won
the victory and impressed their principles on the
entire nation. It was no mere sense of the superi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>ority
of Jahvism that sustained them for the longest
part of this contest. That could only be felt
strongly towards the end, when the chief fruit of the
struggle had been gained. Their fierce patriotism
was their real strength. To them Jahveh seemed
to be King of Israel, and his law the constitution
of their state. In idea their government was a
theocracy; even an earthly viceroy impaired
Jahveh’s prerogatives.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> This was possible because
Jahveh was the national god, universally recognized
as such. As the national god, the worship of him
was patriotism; he was the ideal object of Israel’s
self-love. All their religious feelings flowed in a
patriotic channel. Church and state were blended
in one; love of their country inspired their
passionate devotion to their religion. This close
union of religious and national feeling afterwards
continued with the relations inverted, patriotic
feeling flowing in a religious channel.</p>

<p>In connection with its intense patriotism, Jahvism
from the beginning must have been distinguished
by a rigid exclusiveness. The greatest danger it
had to face was the corruption of the Israelites
by the religions of the peoples around them. To
guard against this danger, it would naturally insist
on the sternest separation of Israel from the
Gentile nations. Circumcision, as well as other
local customs, it used as means of fulfilling its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
purpose. Jahvism was probably at first fiercely
cruel. The injunctions to extirpate the Canaanites
contained in the books of the law, which Professor
Kuenen considers to be the expression of the
Jewish hatred of foreigners after the captivity,
and only “murder on paper,” in all likelihood
faithfully represent the feelings of the Jahvists in
early times. They must have seen their fellow
Israelites constantly deserting Jahveh for the gods
of other peoples, and it is natural that they should
have wished to remove such temptations in the
most effective manner. Probably they did not
succeed in gratifying their desires, except in a
few instances when national feeling was strongly
roused. The Israelites in general, we may be
sure, were easily corrupted, and were in too much
sympathy with foreign gods to destroy their
worshippers. But the Jahvists must have been
fierce haters of foreigners, and eager in every way
to build an insurmountable wall around Israel.
This strict exclusiveness, inevitable and, indeed,
praiseworthy in early times, afterwards came into
collision with the higher tendencies of Jahvism
when it attained its maturity. The subsequent
Messianic ideal, as it existed in the noblest minds,
involved a struggle against these influences, which,
in its youth, had been a hard shell enclosing and
protecting the Jewish religion.</p>

<p>For the most part the battles of Jahvism must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
have been with the local religions of the lands the
Israelites conquered.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Intermixing with the conquered
peoples, in race kindred to themselves,
they would readily adopt the divinities they found
in possession of the soil. Thus, in different districts,
Jahvism was opposed to different religions<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>—a fact
which was afterwards the subject of the bitter
irony of Jeremiah.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> But its longest and most
important conflict was with the religion of Baal,
some particular deity worshipped under this generic
title. The history of Elijah illustrates the severity
and uncertainty of the struggle. To the Jahvists
probably its fierceness was wholly due. They
would tolerate the existence of no other religion,
and so, in self-defence, other religions were bound
to persecute them. This long contest with Baal
must have been of great service to Jahvism.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> It
strengthened the fanaticism of the Jahvists, and
showed vividly to the people the zeal their religion
inspired. When actually put face to face with
other gods, the superiority of Jahveh must have
been so manifest as to gain for him many adherents.</p>

<p>During the early history of Israel, up to the
time of the kings, in spite of occasional interruptions,
the national fortunes were prosperous, and
the territory of the Israelites increased in extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Jahvism, as the national religion, would naturally
share in the prosperity of the state. In the golden
age of Israel, the age of David and Solomon, it
must have had great nominal power. The large
Israelitish empire which then existed must have
appeared convincing proof that the national deity
had kept his part of the covenant, and so the
people would be more disposed to abide by theirs.
But Jahvism could not have really sunk into the
hearts of the Israelites; their devotion to it was
strong in the sunshine, but failed in the storm.
When the kingdom was split in two, and the
fortunes of the Israelites steadily declined, and
great empires, in comparison with which, even
united, they were as nothing, overshadowed them,
then Jahvism seemed threatened with utter ruin.
Only the devotion of its true adherents, whom the
days of its success had enabled to develop in
appreciation of its value, saved it from destruction.</p>

<p>Still, even during the closing struggle, Jahvism
must have included in its ranks a large proportion
of the people. The language of the prophets is
clear evidence of this. The strong phrase, “I am
full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of
fed beasts,”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> which Isaiah puts in the mouth of
Jahveh, is a proof that many sacrifices were then
being offered to him. Signs of only a formal
adherence they probably were; and it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
merely to extend the nominal limits of their religion,
but to change this formal adherence into a real
grasp of its principles, that the prophets fought
their battle and won Israel for Jahveh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<small>THE MESSIANIC FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time of the prophets Jahvism had grown
into Judaism. Their religion, with the examination
of which we shall be mainly occupied in this
chapter, in all cases was a pure monotheism; they
worshipped Jahveh as God, sole maker and ruler
of heaven and earth. It was Judaism, too, in the
sense that it was universally recognized as the
national religion. That Jahveh was properly
the god of Israel was now admitted by all. And
this the prophets unhesitatingly assumed. They
did not regard themselves as preachers of a religion
who sought to persuade others of its truth; they
were rather, in their own eyes, champions of loyalty
against rebels and traitors false to their parent
Israel. For while they believed that Jahveh was
God, the creator of all the world, he was still much
more to them the god of Israel “his servant, the
seed of Abraham his friend.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Patriotism was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
essence of their religion. Even when the later
prophets reached their highest exaltation in dreaming
of the return of all men to the knowledge of
God, they were thinking of the welfare of the
Gentiles far less than of the glory of Israel. And
this, too, inspired their passionate hatred of sin.
They hated it not merely for its own sake, but as
an act of civil revolt against Jahveh, which called
down his vengeance on their country. As Jahveh
was head of the state, sin was a political offence,
and they condemned it accordingly with the
fervour of condemnation so rare in moral, so
common in political questions. The grand poetry
of denunciation with which they enriched the
literature of the world sprang from local feeling
based on local requirements.</p>

<p>Previous to this period no prophetical writings
are found. And yet there must have been prophets
of Jahveh before; indeed, many such are mentioned
in the Jewish historical books. Evidently prophetic
activity was less needed before. Jahvism had
prospered with the prosperity of the nation; but
when the national fortunes declined, and the great
Assyrian empire threatened Judæa, it began to
lose its hold on the people. To save itself, it
rallied all its strength, and the splendid period of
prophetic energy, which has handed down to us
so many noble works, was the result. The prophets
saved Judaism. We owe to them an inestimable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
debt of gratitude, for they were the channel through
which flowed the higher religious forces of the
world. It was well that the crisis came no earlier,
or perhaps their religion would not have been
sufficiently developed to call forth such magnificent
powers in its defence.</p>

<p>Intensely patriotic as the prophets were, the
chief object that engaged their attention was the
depression of Israel’s fortunes. However weak
the allegiance of the Israelites in general to him
had been, still they were Jahveh’s people, his
representatives on earth.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> In spite of much back-sliding,
he had given them prosperity, and under
the first kings had made them a powerful nation.
In their own time, on the other hand, the early
prophets saw Israel divided and weak, and
threatened with utter destruction; and the later
prophets saw this destruction fall on one kingdom
after the other, until the national existence ceased.
Believing that all events were under the control
of Jahveh, and that he had made the covenant
with Israel mentioned in the last chapter, they
could accept only one explanation of their country’s
calamities. They could not imagine Jahveh false
to his promise, and so the alternatives would be
presented to them as the second Isaiah puts them
before his countrymen: “Behold, Jahveh’s hand
is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities
have separated between you and your God, and
your sins have hidden his face from you, so that
he will not hear.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> This is the burden of all the
preaching of the prophets. They were ever saying
to their countrymen, “You have broken your
covenant; you have deserted Jahveh; and now
he has deserted you.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The almost invariable
image under which they describe Israel is that of
an adulterous woman who has forsaken her husband.
By their violation of the covenant, the
Israelites had provoked Jahveh’s wrath, and all
their misfortunes were sent as a punishment by
him.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Compelled professionally thus to believe that
Israel had been false to Jahveh, the prophets were
not good judges of the actual extent of this falsehood.
They denounced the wickedness of the
people, not so much because they saw it as because
they felt it must be there as the explanation of
Jahveh’s harshness. Hence it is very likely that
their reports of the evil doings of their countrymen
are exaggerated. If we did not know from internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
probability that the religion of Jahveh was then
in danger, we might suspect that the prophets
were fighting imaginary foes. Knowing, however,
that they must have had great forces opposed to
them, we can allow for the exaggeration, and yet
admit the general truth of their statements.</p>

<p>The people they addressed could hardly have
been in a position to defend themselves against
the strictures of the prophets by even to this extent
taking exception to their denunciations. With the
decline of Israel, Jahvism had also declined, and
the Israelites must have felt instinctively that the
second phenomenon was the cause of the first, and
that their own exceptional sinfulness had produced
the national disasters. They might, indeed, so far
as they knew the past history of their country,
complain that the people of Israel had before
transgressed as heavily without receiving such a
severe punishment from Jahveh. But here the
prophets met them fully on their own ground, by
denouncing their past as well as their present
wickedness, and by asserting that, his long-suffering
patience having at length given way, Jahveh was
then punishing them for the whole course of their
national sins. Only once in the prophetical books
is there any sign that the people ever ventured to
question the premisses of the prophets. On one
occasion they are said to have replied to Jeremiah’s
denunciations by asserting that their misfortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
were really due to their having forsaken other
gods for Jahveh, and by announcing that they
would return to these divinities, the worship of
whom had been accompanied by prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> It
was a dangerously strong argument to use against
the prophets, and it naturally stirred Jeremiah to
a fiercer fury of malediction. But, in general, the
people could not have had either the critical power
or the knowledge of their own history needed for
the adoption of such a line of defence. The steady
darkening of Israel’s prospects must have seemed
to them grim confirmation of the prophetic statements.
As prophet after prophet arose screaming
against their wickedness, pointing to their misfortunes
as the punishment inflicted by Jahveh,
and announcing that worse calamities would come
before the completion of it, they must have seen
in every national disaster a proof that the prophets
were divine envoys, and a chill of fear must have
driven them to Jahveh’s feet.</p>

<p>Prophets and people stood on common ground
in their patriotism. The attention of all the
Israelites must have been absorbed in watching
the national prospects. The prophets, necessarily
including in their number the best and wisest
minds, of course saw more clearly than the rest.
Probably most of them had the acuteness to see
how inevitable was the destruction of Israel. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the group of small kingdoms fringing the eastern
side of the Mediterranean was threatened by the
vast power of inland Asia, it was not difficult to
foresee the ultimate issue. Still the prophets, in
their own way, did their best to avert their country’s
ruin. Every prophetic declaration was a political
pamphlet giving political advice. All their counsel
was simply the development of a single precept—Rely
on Jahveh only. In home matters this
principle of action could do no harm, but it had
a bad effect on foreign policy. When the great
Assyrian empire was overshadowing Israel and
all the kingdoms around, it did not require much
wisdom to perceive the advantage of an alliance
against the common danger. Nevertheless, the
whole prophetic influence was used to prevent it;
the states were separately attacked, and perished
one by one. Egypt was far the most powerful
of the countries near Palestine opposed to Assyria,
and its protection would have been of enormous
value to Israel. And yet at a time when both
were threatened, Isaiah thundered against an
alliance with Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and probably prophetic
advice was the cause of the almost inconceivable
folly of the religious Josiah’s attack on an Egyptian
army actually invading Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> So far as the
prophets thus contributed to the political overthrow
of Israel, they served the higher interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of their religion; but evidently a foolish fanaticism
dictated their action, a belief that Jahveh
would be dishonoured if his people allied themselves
with strangers, and that, if they trusted
to him alone, he would finally deliver them from
their enemies.</p>

<p>As the national ruin of the surviving kingdom
of Israel drew nearer, the prophets had to fight
more fiercely on behalf of their religion. The
people must have been as angry with Jahveh as
he was said to be with them. The prophets
met their anger with more savage denunciations
of their wickedness, and more severe predictions
of calamity. The division between prophets and
people became then most strongly marked, and
the struggle between them resembled a civil war.
The life of Jeremiah, the most national of all the
prophets, was one long battle. The evil doings
of his countrymen he held to be the cause of
all Israel’s misfortunes, and he hated them with
a bitter hatred. This hatred they fully reciprocated;
he was imprisoned and almost put to
death. When the chief prophet of the religion
of Jahveh received such treatment at the hands
of the people, the religion itself must have been
in terrible danger. If this period had been prolonged,
perhaps Judaism would have preceded
the kingdom of Judah in its fall.</p>

<p>But the destruction of the national polity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Israel came in time to save the national religion.
When Judæa was merely a province of a great
empire, the nationality of the Jews could survive
only in the religion of which Jahveh was the
head. The very manner in which the change
took place was exceptionally favourable to Judaism.
The captivity, the carrying away of the
best families of the Jews into an inland district
of the empire, was admirably calculated to destroy
Jahveh’s rivals. The nucleus of the nation, placed
in such close contact with foreign religions, by
patriotism alone would have been made sincere
worshippers of Jahveh. Far away from the local
idolatries of Judæa, the exiles accepted the pure
religion of the prophets. The most imaginative
and the most spiritual of the greater prophets,
Ezekiel and the second Isaiah, sprang from their
ranks. And thus at last the prophetic became
the popular religion, and Jahveh as God reigned
over Israel. When the exiles returned to Judæa,
they carried with them a pure and moral monotheism.
The remainder of the people readily
adopted their principles. Judaism from this time
was the sole religion of the Jews, the expression of
their national patriotism. Consolidated now finally
into the rigid system of the law, with a multitude
of minute observances that kept it constantly
before their eyes, it was placed beyond reach of
attack. Henceforth all Jahveh’s people wor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>shipped
Jahveh only, professed obedience to his
precepts, and knew him as the one true God.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Thus, in outward semblance, the prophets won
their battle. They won it in consequence of the
events they most bitterly deplored. With their
religion the only security of their nationality, the
Jews never afterwards wavered in their allegiance
to it. Persecution made them cling to it more
firmly; it inspired them in the noblest period of
their history, the crisis which produced the Maccabees.
Even when an empire greater than the
Chaldean conquered them, and a severer sentence
exiled them from Judæa, dispersed over the world,
they held to their religion. The moral monotheism
which Jahvism had developed was now unalterably
settled. New doctrines were added to it,
some of which became of the first importance,
but its primary principles were fixed for ever.
And yet, at the very moment at which Judaism
was thus established, there was sown the seed of
a new religion, destined ultimately to spring from
it in defiance of its spirit of privilege. The nobler
prophets sought to make their religion the national
glory of Israel, a blessing to be taken by all the
world meekly from Israel’s hands; and their efforts
long afterwards produced a religion which ignored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
national distinctions. For at the time of the full
development of Judaism the movement towards
Christianity began.</p>

<p class="tb">The expectation of a Messiah was the most
peculiar feature of the Jewish religion. It was a
fundamental principle of the community of Israel,
says Ewald, “that every real divine deliverance
could be attained only by the instrumentality of
a true prophet.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The cause of this reliance on
divine envoys was probably the rigid theocratic
character of their Jahvist constitution, which discouraged
general enterprise. The belief that a
covenant had been originally concluded with
Jahveh tended to produce dependence on him;
his worshippers looked for help to him, and not
to themselves. Any great man who felt himself
impelled to lead the people in times of national
peril, was sure to consider himself Jahveh’s representative,
commissioned by him for the purpose;
and, of course, all Jahvists would naturally be of
the same opinion. In time this reliance on individuals
became fixed, and gave the Messianic
colour to the national hopes.</p>

<p>The hopes themselves were encouraged by the
want of enterprise which invested them with their
personal character. Hope is but a form of dreaming,
and the worst men of action are the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
dreamers. Jews who believed in the power of
Jahveh were naturally hopeful. As the national
fortunes sank lower and lower during the prophetic
period, it was impossible for such a people not
to expect an ultimate restoration of Israel’s greatness.
The prophets, in particular, were impelled
in this direction. Being men of imagination rather
than action, whose intense patriotism was blended
indissolubly with trust in Jahveh, they were strongly
urged to hope for Messianic deliverance. Israel,
after all, was Jahveh’s people, and Jahveh could
never forsake his people, or allow them to be
utterly destroyed. For their sins they were being
punished, but the punishment could not last for
ever. Jeremiah even expostulates with Jahveh
for permitting his people to be so degraded, and
“the vanities of the Gentiles” to seem superior
to him.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Sooner or later Jahveh would assert his
power, and vindicate his glory as ruler of the
world. Though the prophets might predict immediate
misfortunes, they all believed that ultimately
the deliverer would be sent to Israel.</p>

<p>In the dreams of the prophets, the work to be
accomplished by this inspired envoy of Jahveh
had important variations. The first and most
natural character he assumed was that of a king
and conqueror, who should lead Israel to victory
and restore the national empire. To the Israelites of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the prophetic age who looked back on the history
of their country, the period of David’s reign
seemed the brightest it had known. Israel had
then been united, internally at peace, and lord of
the peoples around. These blessings were believed
to have been obtained specially by the skill and
power of David himself; and so, by a familiar
process of thought, the Messiah became a second
David, coming to do the work of the first by
reviving the old prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> With the earlier
prophets this was almost the sole kind of Messianic
dream. When the punishment of Israel
should be complete, the Messiah was to come as
a prince and warrior, and make the nation greater
than it ever had previously been.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>After the overthrow of the northern kingdom,
this national Messianic ideal naturally included the
restoration of its scattered captives to their native
land. The Samaritan captivity seemed to the
prophets to be designed by Jahveh as a destruction
of the fatal system of dualism which had undermined
Israel’s strength. Henceforth the Israelites
were to be one people, with Jerusalem as their
centre and capital. When the kingdom of Judah,
too, was conquered, and its chief classes also carried
away into captivity, of course the restoration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
exiles became the most important part of the
Messiah’s mission. But even before this, the prophets
of Judah, warned by the fate of Samaria, and
aware of the customs of the Assyrian and Chaldean
empires, foresaw and predicted the great captivity,
and, in consequence, included a subsequent restoration
in their Messianic dreams. Thus by nearly
all the prophets the restoration of the captives to
their country was regarded as the prelude to the
events of the Messianic period, either to be
accomplished by the Messiah personally, or to be
immediately followed by his appearance. In so
confidently predicting the restoration, the prophets
were only giving expression to the national hopefulness,
but they might have based their expectation
on stronger grounds. The cohesive influence
of their religion was sure to prevent the Jewish
exiles from being lost in the peoples among whom
they were placed; and if they managed to preserve
their nationality, it was likely that, sooner or later,
they would be restored to Judæa. The absence of
this influence was probably the reason why no
restoration followed the captivity of the kingdom
of Samaria. The religion of Jahveh was never so
strong in it as in the kingdom of Judah, and must
have been then too weak to serve as a national
support. When the second captivity occurred,
Judaism was able to meet it and to save the
nationality it was designed to destroy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>After the restoration had taken place, fulfilling
the predictions of the prophets under circumstances
very different from those which they had expected,
the Messianic ideal had, of course, to be disconnected
from it. Sufficient ground still existed for
looking forward to the coming of the Messiah.
Israel was only semi-independent, a small state at
the mercy of Gentile masters. But the disappointment
of the Messianic expectations which had
been connected with the restoration must have
given a blow to the spirit of prediction. During
the rebuilding of Jerusalem, the voices of the
prophets grew faint and feeble; and after the
restoration was complete, only one broke the silence.
The Jews had to fall back on faith in the ultimate
fulfilment of earlier prophecies, regarding the establishment
of Judaism as the religion of all Israel,
as the beginning of the reconciliation of Jahveh
and his people which should finally secure their
prosperity.</p>

<p>So far as the Messianic ideal of the prophets
took this national form, it greatly helped to effect
their union with the people. All the people were
thoroughly at one with them in wishing for the
national glory of Israel. If, by proclaiming Jahveh’s
anger and predicting misfortunes, they excited
popular displeasure and dislike, equally, by promising
his favour and predicting prosperity, they excited
popular feelings of pleasure and good-will. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
this part of their preaching sugared the pill of their
denunciations, and probably had a large share in
giving them their final success. As the condition
of Israel grew more desperate, their confidence in
an ultimate revival of good fortune must have
seemed a tower of strength to desponding minds.
During the captivity, when their store of malediction
had become exhausted, and only that of
blessing remained, they promised nothing but
happiness. This, of course, would render the prophetic
religion agreeable to the people, and so
must have contributed to make it the religion of
Israel.</p>

<p>Though most of the prophets included in their
Messianic dreams the material greatness of Israel,
they were far too highly developed to look for this
alone. The noble morality, the noble conception
of God, which formed the essence of their religion,
made social and political prosperity seem to them
of only secondary value. In their ideas, the chief
result of the Messiah’s coming was to be the
reconciliation of Jahveh and his people through
their abandonment of sin. They expected the
establishment of a new covenant, that could not be
broken like the old, when the law of Jahveh should
be written in the hearts of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The grandest
religious language the world has ever known is
the expression of this dream of a people wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
free from sin; the heavenly new Jerusalem of
Christianity is only a vague copy of the ideal
Jerusalem which the prophets imagined for earth.</p>

<p>This vision of a sinless age was present to all
the prophets, and is the chief feature of their
prophecies. It was preserved in the sacred literature
of the Jews; and, after forming for centuries
a perpetual incentive to religious purity, it finally
produced all that is best in Christianity. Back to
it are traceable the forces which moulded the
personal character of Christ, and stamped upon
Christianity its noble morality. The first Christians
not only believed in the coming of this ideal
age, but struggled actually to realize it, and made
the nearest possible approach to success. In the
hopes of most of the prophets it was closely connected
with the national Messianic ideal, the vision
of Israel as a prosperous and powerful state. But
it was also connected, in the minds of the noblest
prophets, with another Messianic ideal, which I
will call the spiritual Messianic ideal—the vision of
the whole world reconciled to God, which produced
Christianity itself.</p>

<p>As pure monotheists, the prophets believed that
Jahveh was not merely god of Israel, but God, the
creator and ruler of the world. Naturally, this
belief that the God of the universe was their
national god was to them a source of intense
spiritual pride. Amos makes Jahveh say to Israel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
“You only have I known of all the families of the
earth,”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and give this fact as a reason for his
severity, as Israel, being so highly favoured, had
sinned doubly in disobedience to him. Such intense
spiritual pride, of course, tended to diminish
their purely political pride. Their race, so greatly
distinguished in religion, could afford to dispense
with material glory. While, viewed thus from a
patriotic standpoint, the belief that the God of the
world was Israel’s Jahveh was a source of national
pride, it also suggested a means of gratifying
national vanity. The homage of subject peoples
constituted the chief attraction of material empire.
Here, however, was a chance of receiving the
homage, not merely of a few nations around them,
but of all mankind. Knowing the universal God,
the Israelites might become a nation of priests by
leading all men to a knowledge of him their maker,
and so have a glory and authority far greater than
any that could be given by political power.</p>

<p>It would not be fair to say that the prophets, in
the formation of this ideal, were influenced only by
patriotism. Spiritually they were too great not to
feel the need of a reconciliation between the world
and its God. In the mind of the noblest of them,
Israel was the servant of the Gentiles, a messenger
of God bringing glad tidings of peace to men.
Still, on the whole, the glory of Israel was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
object of their zeal for the conversion of the
Gentiles. They dreamed of all the world coming
to take the truth meekly from Israel’s hands.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
Jerusalem was to be the sacred city of the earth,
and Judæa, as afterwards during the Crusades, the
Holy Land. The second Isaiah gives the highest
expression to this dream. “Nations shall come to
thy light,” Jahveh promises Jerusalem, “and kings
to the brightness of thy rising. Strangers shall
build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister
unto thee. Thy gates also shall be open continually;
they shall not be shut day nor night;
that men may bring unto thee the riches of the
nations. The sons of them that afflicted thee shall
come bending unto thee, and they shall call thee
the city of Jahveh, the Zion of the Holy One of
Israel. I will make thee an eternal excellency, a
joy of many generations. Violence shall no more
be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction
within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls
Salvation, and thy gates Praise.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> As spiritual
guides and teachers, the Israelites thus would be
the Levites of mankind, a sacred people intermediate
between the world and God.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The spiritual Messianic ideal of the second Isaiah
was both nobler and more vividly conceived than
that of any other of the prophets. But nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
of them have given some expression to it. Even
the fiercely national Jeremiah, who hated the
Gentiles so bitterly that, though he believed them
to be Jahveh’s instruments for the chastisement of
Israel, he prayed that they might be punished for
their assaults on the sacred city, had a vision of
their coming to Jahveh.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> And, indeed, there was
an inevitable pressure on the prophets which forced
them in this direction. In proportion as the
spiritual greatness of their religion was understood
by them, they were driven to adopt the spiritual
Messianic ideal. The experiences of the prophetic
period, besides, must have shown them how impossible
it was that the small people of Israel should
ever equal or surpass in material power the mighty
Gentile empires which then first came in contact
with them. So everything tended to make them
seek the satisfaction of their patriotism in the
extension of their religion.</p>

<p>So far as this ideal entered into it, an inversion
in the relations of political and religious feeling
now occurred in Judaism. Previously, as pointed
out in the last chapter, Jahveh being the national
god of Israel, religious feeling flowed in a patriotic
channel. In the prophetic age, on the other hand,
patriotic feeling began to flow in a religious
channel. Jahveh before had been subordinate to
Israel; then Israel became subordinate to Jahveh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
It is obvious that there was nothing exceptional in
this change, and that the circumstances of Jewish
history amply explain its occurrence.</p>

<p>Here, accordingly, we have the historical explanation
of the production of Christianity. From
the beginning Jahvism was bound to develop into
a noble monotheism. Also from the beginning it
was a national religion. Being a national religion,
in it patriotic was blended with religious feeling.
Under these circumstances, if, after its full development,
a permanent decay took hold of the state
with which it was connected, it had, as an exceptionally
pure religion, to become the basis of
national pride, to make proselytism its end. But
the history of the world during this central period
of Judaism is the history of the great empires of
western Asia. The small people of Israel could
offer no effective resistance to their power, and so,
under pressure from them, the magnificent national
religion of Israel was compelled to become the
expression of patriotism, and to aim at the conversion
of the world. So far, then, as Christianity was
a movement towards the establishment of the
Jewish religion as the religion of the world—and
at first it was nothing else—it was inevitable. The
conditions of Israel’s history made an expansion of
Judaism—or rather, an attempt to expand Judaism,
its success depending on external circumstances—a
necessary occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>A tendency to remodel the form of Judaism was
a consequence of the spiritual Messianic ideal.
When struggling against rival religions, Jahvism,
as we saw in the last chapter, was forced to become
strongly exclusive. To keep itself pure from corruption,
and also to assert its own high dignity,
it had to enclose itself in a hard shell of formal
observance. But when it developed into Judaism,
and sought to become a world-conquering religion,
this formalism was a hindrance to its purpose.
The barriers that were so useful for defence interfered
with offensive movements. Accordingly, the
prophets who recognized the higher ideal of Judaism
revolted against its formalism. Its initial rite, circumcision,
was the chief mark of separation between
the Jews and the mass of the Gentiles. But the
whole sacrificial system was also, in its way, an
expression of exclusive tendencies. Sacrificing in
one manner distinguished the Jew from the Gentile,
who sacrificed in another manner. Moreover, circumstances
at this time were accentuating the
exclusiveness of Judaism. As Israel fell more and
more into the power of strangers, of course the
people’s hatred of strangers grew stronger. This
feeling, which, by throwing the people back on the
national religion, was in one respect of service to
the prophets, naturally expressed itself in Judaism
by increasing its exclusiveness. So Judaism was
tending to be narrowed just when the prophets
wished it to be enlarged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>The prophets met this tendency with a crusade
against formalism. Circumcision they declared to
be only a symbol of obedience. A people “uncircumcised
in heart” Jeremiah called his countrymen.
They pronounced sacrifices of small importance in
comparison with personal righteousness. “Wherewith
shall I come before Jahveh and bow myself
before the high God?” said Micah. “Shall I come
before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a
year old? Will Jahveh be pleased with thousands
of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
Shall I give my firstborn for my transgressions,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He
hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what
doth Jahveh require of thee, but to do justly, and
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God?”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Here the regular sacrifices of orthodox
Jahvism are actually compared with the human
sacrifices of corrupted Jahvism, and are subjected
to the same condemnation. The second Isaiah
even goes so far as to assert that sacrifices are
offensive to Jahveh, as it is degrading him to
suppose that such offerings can please him.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Of
course the high development of their religion had
also some effect in making the prophets adopt this
principle. A system of animal sacrifices did not
accord well with their noble theism. A righteous
life, besides, they felt to be the best offering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
God, and they knew that formal observances distracted
attention from morality. But still they
assailed the formalism of Judaism mainly because
it imprisoned the religion of Jahveh in nationality;
they wished Judaism to be a purely spiritual
religion to which all national customs would be
equally foreign.</p>

<p>Of course they expressed their desires in their
Messianic dreams. They dwell upon the glories
of the spiritual religion of which Jerusalem was
to be the centre, when Jahveh would speak face
to face with all his people, with no barrier of
priestly formalism between. From the time of the
prophets, all who clung to the spiritual Messianic
ideal must have shared their feelings; and when
Christianity afterwards broke through the fetters
of Jewish ceremonialism, its action was strictly in
accordance with the principles of those who originated
and continued the movement in Judaism of
which it was finally the issue.</p>

<p>The spiritual Messianic ideal from the prophetic
age necessarily formed the ideal of the best and
purest Jews. In the writings of the prophets,
especially in those of the second Isaiah, it remained
before the people, a constant incentive to all who
grasped the true principles of their pure religion.
It was easily blended with the additions then
beginning to be made to Judaism, the supernaturalism
which rendered Judaism less cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
unattractive. But though this ideal was sure to
continue as the expression of the noblest aspirations
of Israel, and though endeavours were certain
to be made to realize it, in its completeness it was
destined to inevitable failure. So far as the prophets
dreamed of Israel’s glory being found in
sharing the religion of the one God with the
Gentiles, they dreamed an unrealizable dream.
From the time of the prophets down to the
destruction of Jerusalem, the great mass of the
Jews, as the years went by, hated all Gentiles with
a bitterer hatred. Their religion became more
confined within the limits of their nationality, and
Jahveh more peculiarly the God worshipped by
Jews alone. It is easy to see that Judaism as
Israel’s religion could not have expanded itself,
and that the national pride of Israel could not thus
have been gratified. Only by leaving nationality
behind, by a movement outward from Judaism
of the most spiritual Jews, could the God of Israel
become the God of the world.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>In this Messianic ideal the conception of the
Messiah personally was vague and undefined. The
second Isaiah expected that the Messiah would
simply bring the captivity to a close, and that the
Messianic glories would then follow spontaneously
as a result of the exhibition of Jahveh’s power.
This more indistinct picture of the spiritual Messiah
was of great service to Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>The belief in atonement by vicarious suffering
mentioned in the last chapter was connected in
a special manner with the spiritual Messianic ideal.
All the prophets believed in atonement by suffering;
they all thought that Jahveh was punishing
his people for their sins, and that the punishment
was the necessary antecedent to the restoration of
his favour. But to those who accepted this Messianic
ideal Israel’s suffering plainly seemed to be
a means of realizing it. The great preacher of it,
the second Isaiah, writing towards the close of the
captivity, saw an obvious connection between it
and the crowning misfortune of his country. Dispersed
among the heathen, the worshippers of
Jahveh appeared to him missionaries of the true
religion, revealers to the world of its God. He
believed that the restoration would be accomplished
by the return of the Israelites under the guardianship
of the converted Gentiles, to be their priests
in the Holy Land.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> But when the captivity was
recognized as an instrument of Gentile conversion,
it was of course regarded as a blessing to the
Gentiles. Beneficial to the Gentile world, it was
not the less harmful to Israel, whose nationality
it almost destroyed. Thus the hurt of Israel was
a blessing to the Gentiles. It would follow from
this, in a mind nursed in the ideas of the Jewish
sacrificial system, that the suffering of Israel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
an atonement for Gentile sins. The Gentiles
clearly had sinned against God, their ignorance
of him was a sin; but in revealing himself to them
he was blessing them, and in blessing them he was
of course forgiving their sins. But this forgiveness
was shown by means of Israel’s suffering; therefore
Israel’s suffering was an atonement for Gentile
sins accepted by God.</p>

<p>We find the results of this train of reasoning
clearly expressed by the second Isaiah. In the
fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, which is the great
Messianic chapter of orthodox Christians, and
which probably exercised an important influence
over the mind of Christ, three kinds of atonement
are described. Partly Israel’s sufferings are represented
as an atonement offered for Israel’s own
sins; partly Israel’s sins are regarded as atoned
for by the undeserved suffering of the few righteous
Israelites, faithful adherents of Jahveh, on whom
the national misfortunes fell as well as on the rest
of the people; while put more strongly, and
running through the whole chapter, is the idea
that Israel’s sufferings atoned for Gentile sins.
The beautiful phrase at the end, “He made intercession
for the transgressors,” means that Israel,
though oppressed and bruised by the Gentiles, was
still ready to be a mediator leading them to God.
In the previous chapter the astonishment of the
Gentiles at the fact that so insignificant a people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
possessed so great a revelation, is described by the
same method of personal illustration, universally
adopted by the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Interpreted Messianically,
in a literal sense, these passages were afterwards
of importance to Christianity.</p>

<p>The prophetic age, as a whole, was thus essentially
a period of transition. In it Judaism was
established, and the movement towards Christianity
begun. Throughout the whole course of Israel’s
history we see a gradual development of religion,
religious forces steadily tending upwards and
evolving higher ideas of God. Before the time of
the prophets, these forces were working out a
pure and moral monotheism; during and after it,
they were working out the release of this monotheism
from the fetters of nationalism, and preparing
a religion for the civilised world.</p>

<p>The circumstances which at this time were
tending to make Judaism a proselytizing religion
were also preparing it for success in its mission.
The religion of the prophets was too pure to
become popular. The absence of supernaturalism,
the freedom from dogma, which made it in essence
so superior to Christianity, rendered it fit only
for the highest minds. Afterwards, when impressed
on Israel in general, it was identified with
a rigid ceremonialism. That such a religion,
deriving no strength from formalism or from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
national feeling, could conquer the Gentile world,
far lower than the Jewish people in religious
development, was of course impossible. But just
at this moment it began to receive additions from
foreign sources which ultimately bridged the chasm
between it and the ideas of ordinary men. The
dispersion of the Jews, which completed the victory
of Judaism, alloyed it with baser elements. So far
as its adherents were placed in contact with idolatrous
religions like the Chaldean, it was rather
secured against corruption. In the Persian religion,
however, which it encountered towards the close of
the captivity, it found an enemy disguised as a
friend. This religion, which was as anti-idolatrous
as the Jewish, and which had a nominal monotheism
underlying its dualism, was marked by a supernaturalism
very different from the simplicity of the
religion of the prophets. A large part of this
supernaturalism was now transferred to Judaism.
The Persian deity of evil became the Jewish
Satan, with a multitude of demons under him
that made man their sport and prey.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> A hierarchy
of angels was constructed, completely foreign to
the prophetic belief in the immediate agency of
God. But the most important doctrine at this
time introduced into Judaism, whether from the
Persian religion or not is a matter of dispute, was
the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
soon became the chief dogma of the Jewish creed.
How far it tended to suit Judaism to Gentile
requirements is shown by a curious passage of the
Apocrypha, which reads like a description of the
doctrine of Pagan Christianity respecting purgatory
and masses for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The more philosophical
Jews afterwards formed themselves into a party
to resist these innovations, but the majority of the
people eagerly adopted them. With the spiritual
Messianic ideal they were readily connected, as
they formed the popular elements needed for
proselytism, and as they tended to place religion
on a personal rather than on a national basis.
We find them the chief strength of Christianity,
which, as the successful embodiment of the outward
forces of Judaism, naturally laid aside the portions
of it unfavourable, and took up the portions of it
favourable, to denationalisation and expansion.</p>

<p>Of course these corruptions of Judaism were the
result of its becoming a popular religion. No
longer confined to the best part of the people, it
paid the penalty of diffusion. The rigid ceremonialism,
which henceforth was its leading feature,
was another consequence of its success. Utterly
obnoxious as such ceremonialism was to the
instincts of the prophets, it was still inevitable
if Judaism was to be the religion of all the Jews.
As Jewish political independence faded more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
more into a memory of a distant past, the people
clung more tenaciously to their religion, more
based their nationality upon it, and made it the
object of their patriotism. This, as it continued,
rendered impossible a religious union of Jew and
Gentile. A religion professed by Gentiles by that
fact alone would have seemed to the vast majority
of Jews to be sufficiently condemned. It became
steadily more apparent that, in order to convert the
Gentile, Judaism had to leave the Jew.</p>

<p>Throughout all this period the expectation of the
Messiah’s coming remained the sole consolation
of the Jewish people. The expectation entered
into every part of their action.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> All Jews believed
that, to obtain the Messiah, they needed to be
reconciled to God, that their sins kept alive his
anger, and delayed the sending of the deliverer.
Many an obscure preacher probably cried in their
ears, “Repent, repent, that the kingdom of
heaven may come,” before John the Baptist, by
synchronizing with Christ, gained a prophetic
celebrity. Indeed, we may be sure that during
this long time of calamity many attempts were
made to realize the Messianic ideals, that many
who claimed to be the Messiah appeared among
the Jews, and earned oblivion by their failure.
When the empire of Rome began to overshadow
them with its massive and enduring power, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
unlike that of their previous masters, a conviction
spread through the Jews that the last days were
at hand.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The expectation of the Messiah grew
stronger, and the passionate longing of the people
tended more and more to secure, as far as was
possible, its own gratification. Into an age of
dreams and hopes, which seethed with restlessness
and discontent, Christ was born.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<small>THE CHRISTIANITY OF CHRIST.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is hardly necessary to say that simply from
the statements of the gospels we cannot construct
an historical life of Christ. Strauss and Baur have
finally determined the question of their historical
value. In the first three, it is true, after making
allowance for the vast growth of legend overspreading
them, useful materials can still be found;
but even these can be depended on only so far as
probability is distinctly in their favour. The last
is simply a philosophical romance, with the
theology of the second century as its basis. We
see the figure of Christ through a mist of legend,
and its real outlines are hopelessly lost. Characters
like the hero of M. Renan’s historical novel are
merely the projections of imagination, coloured
undisguisedly by the medium through which they
are viewed. Only by study of the religion he
founded can trustworthy knowledge of Christ be
obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>But in this way, as far as general results are
concerned, we can arrive at almost certain knowledge.
We can be sure, for instance, that the
exceptional goodness of Christ was no figment of
the gospels. The new morality which Christianity
introduced into the world of practice, the morality
which makes inward purity a test of virtue rather
than outward actions, must have been derived
from him. Its origin must have been in personal
influence, and Christ’s alone could have permanently
stamped it on Christianity. And this,
of course, renders it likely that sayings of striking
moral beauty attributed to him in the gospels,
such as “Love your enemies,” “Judge not, that ye
be not judged,” and the perfect one not in the
gospels, “It is more blessed to give than to
receive,” were in substance actually uttered by
him, for they are in harmony with the character
of exceptional goodness which he must have
possessed. So far, at least, we can have a sure
knowledge of Christ which entitles him to our
willing reverence.</p>

<p>Not only is it necessary to distrust the positive
evidence of the gospels, but even negatively their
evidence cannot wholly be allowed. They may
suppress what is true as well as assert what is
false. For instance, they represent Christ as
obtaining great success immediately after his
entrance on his ministry. Now nothing could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
more unlikely than this. He could not have been
accepted as the Messiah by even a small number
of disciples without a long probation previously, a
period of struggle and unsuccess. In the gospels
themselves the explanation of this omission is
suggested, when Christ is said to have been thirty
years old at the time he began to preach. At
about this age, after a youth of conflict and uncertainty,
he probably was first recognized as the
Messiah. But naturally those who knew him
only as the Messiah could not dream of a period
when none regarded him as such. Hence the
account in the gospels, the years of development
and failure having passed out of remembrance.</p>

<p>The true historical evidence on which to found
a life of Christ consists of the statements of the
synoptical gospels, tested and interpreted by probability.
It is obvious that in this way only
knowledge of the broadest and most general nature
can be obtained. If special circumstances of
Christ’s life, as reported in the gospels, are accepted
according as they appear to be probable, the result
naturally varies with the character of the student.
In these cases probability, in the scientific sense,
does not exist. And thus far the greater part of
the statements of the gospels are properly outside
the region of historical investigation. Some are so
distinctly improbable that we can pronounce them
inaccurate; some are so distinctly probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
we can pronounce them accurate; but the vast
majority of them, the test of probability being
absent, cannot be pronounced either accurate or
inaccurate; we simply cannot tell.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to determine the nature of the
personal character and religious ideas of Christ, it
is on this general kind of probability that I chiefly
rely, appealing to the gospels to corroborate it
more than to it to corroborate the gospels. Such
probability in certain cases is the surest kind of
historical evidence, and may safely be depended
on, even in the absence of written confirmation.</p>

<p>That Christ stood exceptionally high in moral
development, was exceptionally good, can be declared,
as we have seen, with practical certainty.
The evidence of the gospels and the evidence of
probability are here in thorough harmony, and the
fact has never been disputed. The evidence of
the gospels and the evidence of probability equally
agree in declaring that Christ was not exempt
from the theological illusions of his age, but their
declaration is called in question by some. As this
point is of vital importance to our subject, we must
now carefully consider it.</p>

<p>Mr. Matthew Arnold has given the clearest expression
to the belief that the religion of Christ
was wholly undogmatic in character. The dogmatic
assertions attributed to Christ in the gospels, were,
according to him, used only in a mystical sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
which the grosser-minded disciples misunderstood.
When Christ, for instance, spoke of his resurrection,
he meant that his moral system would triumph
after his death; but his disciples understood his
words in a personal sense. Christ, Mr. Arnold
says, spoke “over the heads of his followers,”
and, in consequence, they failed to understand
him, and ascribed their own ideas to him. The
evidence on which Mr. Arnold founds his theory
is extremely slight; in fact, he practically rests
it on the few stories in the gospels where Christ
uses figurative language, which his disciples
misunderstand, as in the case of his injunctions
respecting the “leaven of the Pharisees.” Now
figurative language of this sort is quite distinct
from the mystical language Mr. Arnold attributes
to him, Hebrew literature being full of the former
and absolutely empty of the latter, and the only
resemblance between them is that they can both
be misunderstood. Mr. Arnold, indeed, by an
elaborate criticism of the last gospel, makes it to
support his theory, its mysticism readily allowing
this to be done; but the fourth gospel has no
historical value. The real basis of the theory is
the reverence which all men feel for Christ, which
renders it difficult for them to believe that he held
opinions differing from their own, and which also
disposes them to imagine that a vast distinction
separated him from those whom he addressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>The strongest argument in favour of the theory
is drawn from the unquestionable fact of the greatness
of Christ. His moral superiority cannot be
disputed, and the success of his system shows that
he must have possessed unique personal power.
But does his moral superiority, or his possession
of wonderful personal power, really prove that he
was free from theological illusion? It is obvious
to every one that the most exalted goodness may
be united with the most implicit belief in the
dogmas of supernatural religion. It is nearly as
obvious that extreme fascination of character, far
from indicating that one who possesses it is superior
to ordinary illusions, is a clear presumption
that he is peculiarly under their control. The
popular power which Christ must have exercised
is strong evidence that he shared the popular
beliefs. The essence of popularity is sympathy;
the popular man must be in sympathy with the
people he meets, and must be ruled by the same
ideas, whether they happen to be right or wrong.
Christ’s popularity, his influence over his simple
Jewish followers, is a fair proof that he was
subject to their religious illusions, that no difference
of deep insight separated him from them.
People always are irritated by hearing what they
do not understand. Had Christ been in the habit
of speaking over the heads of his disciples, not
many would have remained with him; he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
thus have acquired a reputation as a philosopher,
but he certainly would not have founded a Church.</p>

<p>In considering this question, we must keep the
facts of experience steadily before us. All who
have ever been widely loved and greatly popular
among average men have had characters remarkable
for moral beauty, and have also been peculiarly
steeped in religious illusions. St. Francis of Assisi
and St. Teresa resembled Christ in spiritual goodness
and in the power of fascinating others, and
they held the crudest religious ideas of their times.
In our own days, men who are justly called heroes,
men like Stonewall Jackson and General Gordon,
who win the love and reverence of all who come
near them, are sure to believe in the most absurd
dogmas. Stonewall Jackson feared that he would
lose a battle if he fought it with powder obtained
by labouring on Sunday, and General Gordon
believed an island in the Pacific to be the private
residence of the devil. Christ’s fascination of
character is additional evidence of his supreme
goodness, but it is far from proving that he rose
above the religious ideas of the crowd.</p>

<p>The reverence we feel for Christ need not in the
least be impaired by recognizing that he was
subject to the illusions of dogmatic religion. Of
his moral superiority we have certain evidence;
and this, and not wisdom, is the true object of
reverence. Had he been profoundly wise, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
with perfect clearness through the deluding phantasms
of life, he could not have been so good. To
be supremely good, to rise far above the standard
of negative morality, and to be inspired by a passionate
devotion to others which leaves no room
for a thought of self, is not compatible with the
colder temperament which examines the foundations
of belief. Wise men may die for a just
cause, but they are never willing martyrs; they
lack not merely the fanaticism, but the power of
forming the exaggerated estimate of the value of
the sacrifice, which martyrdom requires. But we
never hesitate in choosing between calm wisdom
and pure enthusiasm as objects of our praise. And
in the same way, Christ’s belief in much that we
think unfounded should be no hindrance to our
reverent admiration of him; we ought rather to
recognize that it is the inevitable accompaniment
of such greatness as his. Only a noble fanaticism,
which leaves no guard against error, could have
inspired his life and secured his success.</p>

<p>We may conclude, then, that Christ accepted
the common religious ideas of his time, that he
believed in the personal God to whom the prophets
addressed their prayers and complaints, and in the
resurrection of the dead. And now, after this
unavoidable digression, we will take up our subject
at the point where we left it at the close of the
last chapter. In referring to the gospels, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
always mean the synoptical exclusively, the last
being put aside as hopelessly unhistorical.</p>

<p>At the time of Christ’s birth the expectation of
the Messiah was rooted more strongly than ever
in the minds of the Jewish people. Nothing but
the Messiah seemed able to save them from the
final loss of the remains of their national independence
at the hands of the irresistible power of Rome.
For in Rome they saw, not a mere conqueror exacting
tribute from subject peoples, but an empire
that steadily absorbed into its own vast mass all
the nationalities of the civilized world. To the
Jews, who valued their nationality above all things,
this fact must have appeared a ground for absolute
despair. The lower orders might be roused
to attempts at passionate resistance, but the
higher classes must have seen the hopelessness of
a struggle against the Roman power, and must
have been impelled to gloomier forebodings by the
fear that at any moment the end might be precipitated
by the unreasoning fanaticism of their
ignorant countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The religion of the Jews,
as Professor Kuenen has pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> tended to
encourage these feelings. Pride in their religion
stimulated their patriotism, and made it harder for
them to submit to the conditions of Roman rule.
Thus the circumstances of the time would heighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the ordinary Messianic hopes, and make the people
look more for the national saviour. The general
unrest, too, would deepen the sense of sin. Wandering
preachers of the class of John the Baptist,
denouncing the sins of the people, and asserting
that their wickedness was bringing on them the
threatened calamity, and calling for repentance, in
order that the Messiah might be sent to deliver
them, such a time would be sure to produce.</p>

<p>In the midst of these Messianic expectations
Christ grew up. The agitation and unrest of the
period must have powerfully stimulated a nature
so impressible in its spiritual beauty. Exceptionally
good men are always keenly responsive to the
religious influences around them, so Christ must
have passed his youth in a world of Messianic
dreams. The sacred literature of his race was
familiar to every Jew; and the spiritual predictions
of the prophets, the vision of an Israel reconciled
to God, must early have enthralled his fancy.
National fanaticism could not have found a place
in his character. In both Messianic ideals, as we
saw in the last chapter, the distinction between
Jew and Gentile was made to contribute either to
the spiritual or to the material glory of Israel.
For the glory of Israel Christ could not have
cared; putting aside national distinctions, he must
have lived only for the welfare of man and for the
glory of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning, his Messianic desires must
have been for the reconciliation of God and man
by the conquest of human sinfulness. As he
watched the ceremonialism which was then the
most distinctive feature of the Jewish religion, he
must have echoed the burning words in which the
prophets proclaimed righteousness to be alone
acceptable to God, and must have denounced all
forms that tended to obscure this truth. His
sympathy would be sure to be with those whom
the Pharisaic rigidity of that ceremonialism shut
out and degraded by exclusion, “the lost sheep of
the house of Israel.” The “inwardness” of Christ,
the stress he laid on the purity of the heart, in the
first instance was probably the result of a reaction
against the formalism of his age, with its minutely
defined outward morality of law. To restore
primitive truths, and to make goodness the essence
of religion, must have always been his aim.</p>

<p>Judging simply from probability, we should say
that there were likely to be three clearly marked
periods in the life of Christ. In early manhood
his longing for the Messianic times would naturally
express itself in the same form in which the
longing of so many of his countrymen was expressed—in
the call to repentance. The wickedness
of the people being regarded as the cause of
God’s anger, the best way to remove his anger and,
consequently, to obtain the Messiah, was to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the people from their sins, Christ’s own personal
hatred of sin also, of course, urging him in this
direction. Thus at first probably he was simply
a preacher like John the Baptist, not claiming to
be the Messiah, but a forerunner of the Messiah,
exhorting the people to repent, and promising
them that the Messiah would come as soon as
they had reconciled themselves to God. Gradually,
while engaged in this work, as he reached
maturity and his powers grew to their full development,
and as with them came the consciousness of
his own greatness, the conviction would force itself
on him that he was himself the promised Messiah,
to be revealed as such by succeeding in his labour,
by converting the people and banishing sin from
Israel. This second period would grow naturally
out of the first. Compared with the other preachers
of repentance, he must have seemed able to obtain
success; his preaching, of course, would be far more
effective than theirs. Such being the case, hope—and
natures like his are always intensely hopeful—would
lead him to imagine himself completely
successful, to believe that at his call all Jews would
turn with pure hearts to God. This result would
be sufficient glory for the Messiah; in the dreams
of the prophets it had been the chief feature of the
Messianic times. During this period he would be
uniformly gentle, without bitterness against any
class, would speak of coming “to call not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
righteous, but sinners to repentance.” Then as
slowly but surely it became evident that his task
was impossible, that the Jews in general cared
nothing for his teaching and despised his pretensions,
he would enter on a third period, with the
end not far off, in which, still firmly holding himself
to be the Messiah, he would appear as the
leader of a new departure like Moses, and, applying
to himself the spiritual ideal of the second
Isaiah, would open his system to the Gentiles, the
obstinate and unrepentant Jews being left to
perish in their sins. During this period he would
become a bitter assailant of those who refused to
accept him; he would denounce the scribes and
Pharisees, and, like the prophets, foretell destruction
for Jerusalem, and thus finally gain for himself
the death of the cross.</p>

<p>Of course no evidence for the first of these three
periods can be derived from the gospels. For
reasons already mentioned, when Christ was once
recognized as the Messiah all the previous part of
his life must have passed into oblivion. But in
the gospels the second and third periods are
clearly indicated; in fact, by referring to them we
explain most of the contradictions in the sayings
ascribed to Christ. As probability and tradition
are so strongly in favour of them, we may assume
the existence of at least these periods to be proved.</p>

<p>The greater part of Christ’s active life probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
belonged to the second period. Declaring that the
kingdom of heaven had come, and exhorting to
righteousness as the condition of sharing in its
blessedness, he wandered through the country districts
of Galilee and Judæa. To the country he
would naturally keep, as there, where the people
were less fiercely national and fanatical, his purer
conception of the Messiah would more readily find
acceptance. In the towns, and especially in Jerusalem,
only the national type of Messiah would be
recognized; and so the gospels are probably correct
in stating that he came first to Jerusalem in
the closing days of his life. The term “Son of
man,” which in the gospels is his favourite name
for himself, was, it is likely, the Messianic title he
claimed, as it marks the recognition of humanity
alone by the minister of God. “Son of David”
was the accepted title of the national Messiah, and
though his followers, we may be sure, often applied
it to him, he would rather shrink from it himself.
He must have gained many adherents during this
period; in the unrest of the age men would easily
yield to the fascination of his character, its gentleness
and hopefulness being still unspoiled by failure.</p>

<p>As he extended the area of his labours and
began to come in contact with the people of the
towns, he would find himself in face of serious
opposition. Here he would meet, not simple
rustics who cared little about ritual and politics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
but legalists and nationalists prompt to condemn
him as irreligious and unpatriotic. The credulity
of his country disciples would be challenged and
his Messianic claims subjected to a hostile scrutiny.
The tendency to dwell on the supernatural inseparable
from such a character as his would be in sharp
contrast to the spirit of worldliness he would
encounter. Some Sadducees even would be likely
to confront him, requiring proof of the postulates
of his teaching, and infecting others with their
scepticism.</p>

<p>Then would begin a time of struggle and irritation.
All who looked for the national Messiah
would be enemies of Christ. They would be eager
upholders of the formal and exclusive elements of
Judaism, and his disregard of these would excite
their bitter opposition. If he neglected traditional
ceremonies or associated with the outcasts of
formalism, he would be denounced as a breaker of
the law, and the friend of publicans and sinners.
Gradually this opposition would produce its effect.
As the minor customs of the law were more and
more put before him as matters of sole importance,
he would be forced into hostility against them; as
the outcries of the legalists grew stronger, the
whole system of legalism would become more discredited
with him. But, above all, he would lose
his expectation of converting Israel. When he
realized by experience the strength of the obstacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to his ideal, he would be compelled to reconsider
his whole position as Messiah.</p>

<p>The effect of this would be to drive him strongly
towards supernaturalism. From the beginning he
must have been disposed to put aside the ordinary
conditions of life. The exaggerated and unworkable
morality of the gospels is probably an accurate
representation of his teaching. With his attention
fixed on the spiritual glories of the Messianic age,
the worldly arrangements around him must have
seemed too transient to be worthy of attention.
This feature of his character would now enable him
to meet the difficulty of his position. He would
turn from earth to heaven. Believing in the resurrection
of the dead, he would use it to justify his
claim to be the Messiah. Rejected by the greater
part of his countrymen, no demonstration of his
power on earth could be pointed to, but he still
could proclaim for himself the future glory of a
second coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>

<p>Opposition, of course, would only strengthen his
belief in himself. But this belief required that he
should realize the glorious ideal of the prophets.
If he could not realize it during his earthly life,
he would have to realize it after his death. The
prophecy in the book of Daniel of one like a son of
man coming with the clouds of heaven, and having
everlasting dominion over all the world,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
now appear to him to be a manifest reference to
himself. Connecting it with the fifty-third chapter
of Isaiah, the chapter easily admitting of an
erroneous interpretation in a personal sense, he
would readily form a new conception of his mission.
The failure to convert Israel would seem part of
his true glory as the suffering Messiah. Despised
and rejected of men, he would only be like all
God’s envoys to the Jews; his rejection would fill
up the measure of Israel’s guilt; and after it the
wicked would finally be swept away, and he himself,
as Messiah, proved by his constancy under
persecution and suffering, would judge those who
had rejected him, and establish his everlasting
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>The necessity of his own martyrdom would soon
become part of his belief. In the state in which
Judæa was then, the forces tending in this direction
were sufficiently obvious. Only an increase of the
opposition he had already encountered, such as
would be produced by his coming into collision
with the fanatical orthodoxy of Jerusalem, was
needed to secure his death as a criminal. There
must have been many reasons to make him
welcome a speedy death. M. Renan is probably
right in conjecturing that Christ began to lose
ground during the later days of his life, the irritability
produced by constant controversy weakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the personal charm of his character. Death would
seem the only remedy for this. The fifty-third
chapter of Isaiah, which Mr. Arnold supposes to
have been always present to Christ’s mind as the
embodiment of his Messianic ideal, is likely to have
been thus before him in this closing period. There
death is represented as crowning the afflictions of
the righteous servant of Jahveh, and a glorious
triumph is promised as its result. Christ would of
course apply the passage to himself, and would
look forward to his death as the condition necessarily
preceding his Messianic glory. Personal
shrinking from pain would count for nothing with
him. If he believed himself to be the divinely
appointed Messiah, the central figure of all the
world’s history, he could not have had one feeling
that was not subservient to his mission.</p>

<p>As soon as this conception of his Messiahship
was developed in his thoughts, he would at once
adopt in its fulness the spiritual Messianic ideal.
Rejected by the vast majority of the Jews—rejected,
moreover, because he was not the national
Messiah, he would be irresistibly impelled to proclaim
himself the spiritual Messiah, in whose eyes
no distinctions of race separated men from God.
Failing with the Jews, there was the more need
that he should turn to the Gentiles; defeated by
Jewish nationalism, Jewish nationalism must have
become hateful to him. He would look now for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the establishment of a spiritual Israel, formed of
all mankind reconciled to God and delivered from
sin. From this time, though he probably did not
preach to them himself, he must have included the
Gentiles in his system.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>He would, of course, impress this new ideal on
his disciples as strongly as he could. It was now
necessary that his system should be preached by
them after his death, so that when he came again
in the clouds of heaven he might find faithful
adherents to share in the glories of his reign. He
would strive to prepare his disciples for his death,
to prevent them from being disheartened by it, and
in doing so he would promise them his return in
power. Thus he would himself originate the dogma
of his second advent, which was the main support
of the early Christian Church. It would not be
very difficult to induce his disciples to accept the
doctrine. They believed in the resurrection of the
dead, and he would merely have to fix in their
minds a conviction that his resurrection would be
immediate; that he, as Messiah, would rise at once
to heaven after his death, thence to return with
unlimited powers to punish and reward. To get
the first part of the doctrine into their heads may
not have been easy; they would not readily understand
that their lord was to die still publicly
unrecognized, with no proclamation of his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>ness;
but once they did understand this, his
promised return in glory would seem best to explain
it, and would suit it to their ambitious dreams.
Probably they never fully understood this portion
of his teaching until after his death, when, of
course, there would be every inducement to
accept it.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to state how strongly the
evidence of the gospels supports this conclusion.
Again and again in them Christ appears preparing
his disciples for his death, and promising his return
afterwards in heavenly glory. But the evidence of
probability would be sufficient to establish it. It
solves the great problem in the history of Christianity;
it explains the passage of Christianity
through the perilous period immediately after its
founder’s death.</p>

<p>Being thus forced to justify himself by appealing
to the supernatural elements of Judaism, supernatural
conditions would necessarily assume more
importance in his eyes. The post-prophetic additions
to Judaism mentioned in the last chapter had
by this time developed a complete system of salvation
and damnation. Heaven and hell were now
fully established in the creed of the Jew, heaven
being appointed for himself and hell for the
Gentile. Christ would naturally accentuate this
part of his religion, and adopt the same spirit of
exclusiveness. Heaven would be for those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
accepted, hell for those who rejected the Messiah.
Probably he now began to lay special stress on the
salvation of the soul in his preaching. And thus
we can understand how Christianity came to
possess in a heightened form the more Pagan
features of Judaism.</p>

<p>The same circumstances which were leading
Christ to exaggerate the portions of Judaism most
favourable to general proselytism, would also cause
him to lay aside the portions of Judaism most
unfavourable to it. His opposition to the legal
and ceremonial elements of Judaism would now
be greatly increased. His worst enemies, of course,
were those who attached most importance to these,
and in their attacks on him formalism must have
supplied them with their most effective weapons.
This would lead him in time to reject formalism
completely. In doing so, he was, as we saw in the
last chapter, strictly fulfilling the spiritual Messianic
ideal. To what extent he made the renunciation
of the law an actual part of his system we cannot
tell, but we may be sure it was to a larger extent
than his disciples were ready to accept. The
forms of Judaism, at least, could not have been
regarded by him as necessary elements of his
religion. He was forced to make his system a
movement out of orthodox Judaism, and he could
not have cared to encumber his new religion with
the worn-out forms of the old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>The account in the gospels of the closing incidents
of Christ’s life is probably in the main
strictly correct. Sooner or later he was sure to go
to Jerusalem. The need to justify his system by
preaching it in the capital, and the wish to found
it securely by his death under persecution, would
alike impel him in this direction. And he would
naturally choose one of the great feasts as the
occasion for his visit to the city. Though the forms
of Judaism had now probably ceased to be an
essential portion of his religion, there is no reason
to suppose that he personally objected to observing
the more important of them. Coming to Jerusalem
to keep the passover, he would find it crowded
with strangers; practically the whole Jewish world
would be concentrated there; and thus he would
obtain the widest possible publicity, both for his
preaching and his martyrdom. That the latter
would necessarily follow the former he must have
clearly seen. In the capital of Judaism, at a time
when a great religious festival excited the fanaticism
of the people to the highest pitch, to preach
a religion that involved the overthrow of legalism
and the equality of Jew and Gentile in the sight of
God, and to do this while claiming to fulfil the
popular expectations, obviously meant a speedy
extinction. So we may conclude that Christ came
to Jerusalem at the time of the passover, probably
accompanied by many of his country adherents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
who were also going to the feast, and that there
by his preaching he provoked against himself the
fanaticism of the priests and the populace, and
was put to death as an offender against the law.
Among the incidents related as occurring now, is
one that established a great dogma.</p>

<p>In the description which the gospels give of the
institution of the Lord’s supper, we have statements
which are corroborated by an important
external authority. The first epistle of St. Paul
to the Corinthians is unquestionably genuine, and
accordingly it ranks as one of the earliest documents
of the New Testament. In it Christ, on the
occasion of his passover feast in Jerusalem, is said
to have broken bread and distributed it among his
disciples, and to have poured out wine and given
it to them, asserting that the bread was his body
and the wine his blood, and ordering them to continue
the practice as a memorial of him. Taking
this passage in conjunction with the corresponding
passages of the gospels, we have in all four statements
so much distinctly expressed; while equally
in all four it is either expressed or clearly implied
that this distribution of his body and blood meant
that his body was broken and his blood shed for
the remission of sins; the only variation in the
passages being the omission by the first two
gospels of the injunction to repeat the ceremony.
Putting this point aside for the moment, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
in the rest of the description an account in which
the three gospels agree, and in which they are
corroborated by a trustworthy external authority.
Unless probability is decidedly against it, this concurrence
of evidence is sufficient to establish its
truth.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>The account, however, has probability distinctly
in its favour. If Christ was alive on the day of
the passover—and there is every reason to suppose
that the gospels are correct when they assert that
he was—he would naturally keep the passover
supper with his disciples, as otherwise his presence
in Jerusalem would be inexplicable. But keeping
the passover, with the expectation of his immediate
death vividly before him, the celebration must
have seemed to him to possess a strange significance.
He believed that the first passover feast
had been celebrated in the time of Moses, that the
blood of the victim sprinkled on their doorways
had preserved the Israelites from harm on the eve
of their departure from Egypt, and that this had
been the earliest rite of the Jewish law. Now he,
of course, must have regarded his system, which
was to be fully established by his death, as the
fulfilment of Judaism. The ceremonies of Judaism,
of which the passover, as first, was chief, belonged
only to the old unfulfilled religion, and not to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
mature Judaism founded by him. So this passover
he was keeping would seem to him, not merely a
commemoration of the first, but, in a proper sense,
actually the last ceremony of the Jewish ritual.
And as it was the last rite of the old, so it was the
first of the new Judaism. His disciples now, like
the early Israelites, were leaving old ways and
beginning a new life as wanderers on strange paths.
As the first ceremony of Judaism had sanctified
its commencement, so this first ceremony of
Christianity might well appear to him to sanctify
its commencement, and to mark the transition
from the old religion to the new.</p>

<p>But where was the victim of this Christian
passover? The Jewish passover was essentially a
sacrifice, and the idea of vicarious atonement was
clearly stamped on it. The Jews believed that,
when the first-born sons of the Egyptians had been
destroyed, the first-born sons of their ancestors had
escaped, through the sprinkling on their doorways
of the blood of a <i>first-born</i> lamb or kid of their
flocks.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Sacrificial substitution is unmistakable
here. Now, as mentioned above, Christ at this
time had probably taken as his ideal the suffering
Messiah thought to be referred to in the fifty-third
chapter of Isaiah. There the supposed Messiah is
spoken of as becoming “an offering for sin,” and
as bearing “the sin of many.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> To Christ’s mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
we must remember, the idea of atonement for sin
by sacrifice was thoroughly familiar, rooted as it
was in the Jewish law. If, then, he believed that
for him as Messiah a death at the hands of others
was ordained, he would at this moment naturally
see in his death an atonement offered for sin.
Though he must have regarded the sacrificial
system of the law as only decreed for a time, he
would still feel that underlying it there was a
divine principle. Recognizing this principle, with
the passage of Isaiah pressing on him a sense of
a connection between it and his death, he would
be sure to find in himself the victim of the Christian
passover.</p>

<p>The idea that his death was an atonement for
sin may have occurred to him before. But whether
it did or not, it must have been fully developed in
his mind by the circumstances under which he
kept this passover. It fitted like a key into the
peculiarities of his religion. As already explained,
his object as Messiah was to found a system which
should secure the happiness of those who accepted
him; on his second coming, they were to enjoy
the felicity of the Messianic period on earth, as
well as the everlasting joys of heaven. If they
were to enjoy felicity, to escape punishment,
through his death, which necessarily preceded his
second coming, how readily would that death
appear to him, as a Jew, an atoning sacrifice for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
their sins! Just as the lamb of the passover had
borne, as a substitute for the Israelites, the penalty
that had fallen on the Egyptians, so he, as their
substitute, would bear for his followers the penalty
that would fall on the rest of the world, the time
at which his death was to take place heightening
the parallel and making it seem to be providentially
designed.</p>

<p>As the victim of the passover, part of it having
been used sacrificially as an expiation, had then
been eaten as food by those whom its sacrifice was
meant to benefit, so here Christ would wish his
body thus to be partaken of sacramentally after it
became an atonement for sin. Sacrifice is usually
followed by sacrament; the victim, being accepted
by the deity, becomes divine, and those who
partake of it are purified by receiving divine
elements into their natures. The sacramental side
of the passover sacrifice was particularly marked.
To complete the parallel, Christ, as the new passover
victim, needed to make his body a sacrament.
But in his case such a sacrament had necessarily
to precede, and not to follow the sacrificial death.
It could only be symbolical. He had, as the
parables of the gospels show, a natural tendency
to use symbolism to express his thoughts.
Symbolically, the sacrament, to prevent coarse
misconception, would best be celebrated by himself.
And so at this passover supper, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
victim appointed by the law had been partaken of,
Christ probably distributed bread and wine as his
body and blood, the symbolical sacrament of his
approaching sacrificial death, the new passover
feast of the new Christian Church. And as the
first passover feast had been commemorated in
Judaism, so he probably commanded his disciples
to commemorate this second one, which fulfilled
and abrogated the first, even as his system fulfilled
and abrogated the system to which the first
belonged, making it thus the only rite of Christianity,
which should symbolise in purity the
coarse sacrificial ritual of Judaism.</p>

<p>Though, of course, there is no certainty in this
conclusion, probability is so much in its favour
that we may assume it to be proved. The positive
evidence alone is sufficient to establish the fact,
and still stronger is the evidence for it arising from
its being an indispensable link in a great chain of
development.</p>

<p>And so we may conclude that the first distinctive
dogma of Christianity was actually originated
by Christ himself. The Church started with belief
in the Atonement, in the sacrificial death of Christ,
the “Lamb of God,” for the sins of men. The
further explanation of this doctrine belongs to our
next chapter.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />

<small>JEWISH CHRISTIANITY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> far in the course of our inquiry we have traced
the development of Christian doctrine simply
through the religious ideas of the Jewish people.
But from this point we shall have to consider the
relations of opposite tendencies, the collision between
Judaism and Paganism in Christianity to which
I have referred in the Introduction. And in dealing
with this subject, it is a fair canon of historical
criticism to say that so far as any dogma is distinctly
Jewish, its origin should be assigned to the
earliest period of the Christian Church, and so far
as any dogma is distinctly Pagan, its origin should
be assigned to a later period, after the conversion
of the Gentiles had begun. The justice of this
canon is evident when we remember that Christianity
at the time of Christ’s death had none but
Jewish adherents, and that thenceforth it grew to
be more and more accepted by Pagans, until at
last its ranks were filled with Pagans alone. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Atonement is the chief Jewish dogma, and the
Incarnation the chief Pagan dogma of Christianity,
and they obviously conform to the requirements of
the canon. For the present we shall be occupied
with the doctrines of Christianity which are mainly
Jewish in form.</p>

<p>Though the Christian Church started with belief
in the Atonement, the dogma at the beginning
could not have been fully grasped and understood.
For a time it was probably only latent in the
doctrines of the Church. His disciples were not
likely at once to recognize the significance of what
Christ did at the passover supper; up to the last
they could hardly have been prepared for his death.
But even with a blind obedience they would naturally
obey their lord’s commands. As they commemorated
the Christian passover and repeated its
forms, the meaning of it would gradually dawn on
their minds. This repetition must have been from
the first the centre of the early Church, a distinctive
ceremony which brought the Christians together
and marked them off from the Jews around them.
While thus incessantly repeating the form of
sacramental communion with the body of Christ,
sooner or later they would be sure to recognize
what this sacramental communion implied, the
sacrificial character of his death. Then the latent
dogma of the Atonement would be fully understood.
As Jews, they would readily accept it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
indeed, it would be to them an explanation of their
strange position as disciples of a crucified Messiah.</p>

<p>As soon as the first Christians recognized that
Christ’s death had been an atonement offered for
their sins, a feeling of lightness and joy must have
arisen in their hearts. Circumstances like those in
which they were placed always tend to develop
strongly a sense of sinfulness and of alienation from
God. But here appeared a means of reconciliation
to God and of escape from the burden of sin. And,
accordingly, it is likely that now their missionary
activity began. The dogma supplied them with
a vindication of their lord’s greatness. Jesus, as
the Messiah, had borne the sins of men, and had
become the representative of men with God. The
Jews, who had so unjustly slain him, were in
special need of divine forgiveness; and we may
be sure that the watchwords of the preaching of
the early Christians, when they preached only to
Jews, were “Jesus and the remission of sins.”</p>

<p>Though the commemoration of the passover
supper was probably the means of impressing the
doctrine of the Atonement on the minds of the
early Christians, there is no reason to suppose that
at first they attached to it an actual sacramental
value. They would naturally repeat the forms of
the sacramental feast they were commemorating
without considering the repetition also to be sacramental.
But before long, as we know from St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Paul’s words,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> the repetition did become sacramental
itself. The Christians then believed that
the elements of Christ’s body were present in the
bread and wine of their Lord’s Supper. At first
this presence may have been regarded as symbolical
only. It is obvious, however, that the delicate
symbolism habitual in Christ’s language was sure
in this instance sooner or later to be misunderstood
by the grosser minds of his followers. The
passage of St. Paul just referred to shows that he
believed the flesh and blood of Christ to be actually
present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist—that
is, present in them by an act of faith, not
changed into them by a formula of consecration.
When the common feast of the early Christians
had thus become a sacramental commemoration of
the sacrifice of Christ’s death, their conception of
that sacrifice must have been strengthened and
made definite. And with this clearer conception
of Christ as the victim that atoned for the sins of
man, whose body was spiritually present in the
food they ate at their sacred supper, would come
a greatly enhanced reverence for him. He would
seem to them more than human; his Messiahship
would gather round it all the highest attributes
ever dreamed of in the Messianic ideals of their
race. Their full missionary energy would then be
displayed. Probably the recovery of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
from the paralysis that must have fallen on it after
Christ’s death began with the recognition of the
doctrine of the Atonement, and was finally completed
when the Eucharist became a sacrament,
a solemn and mysterious ceremony, the central
expression of Christian belief.</p>

<p>The preaching of Christianity must have been
far easier after its founder’s death. Reverence for
Christ could rise to greater heights. Supernatural
powers could be attributed to him without any fear
of too dangerous a challenge. And, besides, the
preachers could disperse themselves. So long as
Christ lived he alone could properly preach his
system, for all Christians would gather closely
round him as their living head. But now every
body of Christians was equally near him, no matter
where they might be, and had the assurance of his
spiritual presence in the elements of the Eucharist.
Henceforth the mission of the Church was proselytism;
growth became its evidence of life.</p>

<p>That proselytism began immediately after
Christ’s death is, of course, very unlikely. The
Church probably took some years to recover from
the shock of its loss. During this period it could
barely have managed to survive as a small body
containing the most faithful of those who had
followed Christ. Among these picked disciples
the development of latent doctrine went on, until
the primary principles of Christianity were estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>lished
on a sure basis. Then, proselytism beginning,
every member of the original body probably
became more or less a missionary. As a select
few they were the preachers and authorities of early
Christianity. The commands of Christ, as well as
the nature of their religion, impelled them to
preach with vigour. At first they would naturally
address themselves to Jews alone. With the Jews
of Palestine they were not likely to make much
way. But when they extended their activity to
the synagogues in foreign countries they would be
more successful. Here, as the fanaticism of race
was less, the spiritual ideal of Christianity would
have fewer obstacles to overcome. Still in all their
dealings with Jews they probably met with little
success. To the Jews Christ crucified was indeed
a stumbling-block which even the promise of his
second advent could not remove. But as soon as
the preachers of Christianity touched the Gentiles,
they must have reaped an abundant harvest. Such
was the disorganization of religion at this time
in the Roman world that, notwithstanding the
harsh exclusiveness of Judaism, Gentiles in large
numbers were becoming proselytes to it. Under
these circumstances Christianity, which had dropped
all the harsh features of Judaism, and had added
to the remainder much that was in harmony with
Gentile ideas, must have easily made converts
among them. Though probably very soon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
majority of Christians were Gentiles, all the heads
of the Church still were Jews, and its principles
remained wholly Jewish. This period of Jewish
Christianity may fairly be said to have lasted in
full vigour until the death of St. Paul.</p>

<p>For more than the second half of this time the
missionary activity of the Church centred in St.
Paul. After Christ himself, no man influenced the
circumstances and doctrines of Christianity more
than he. The stress laid upon faith as a means of
salvation in early Christianity was largely the
result of his personal character. A renegade from
the most rigid legalism of Judaism, he naturally,
as a Christian, passed to the other extreme, and
exalted faith above the righteousness of works.
The same recoil from Judaism made him the
apostle of the Gentiles. But though St. Paul was
as little Jewish as an unhellenised Jew could be,
and strained the doctrines of Christianity greatly
in the direction of Gentile ideas, his religion was
still essentially Jewish. In his epistles—putting
aside his references to the resurrection of the dead,
made because he was writing to Gentiles who
were not familiar with the doctrine—as well as in
the other books of the New Testament that belong
to this period, we find stress laid chiefly on two
dogmas, the Atonement and the second advent.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
These two dogmas were closely connected, and
were the strength of the early Church.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Atonement was that Christ
had died for the sins of the world. “God was in
Christ,” says St. Paul, “reconciling the world unto
himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
The term “world,” as used in this and kindred
passages, can only be understood by keeping the
doctrine of the second advent steadily in view.
All the glories predicted by the prophets for the
Messianic times were transferred in the expectation
of the early Christians to the period of the second
coming of Christ. They believed that when their
lord returned there would be literally “new
heavens and a new earth.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> This new world, then
to be established in fulness, they held to have been
actually founded by the death of Christ, which had
rendered it possible by relieving man from the
burden of sin. But in their case only had sin
been thus put away, and accordingly they were
the foundation of the world reconciled to God,
which after the second coming of Christ would
remain alone, the old world of sin and alienation
from God which still survived beside the new being
then finally destroyed. Christ had left them to
preach the gospel, that is, to snatch souls from the
perishing to the permanent world. The latter
seemed to them the real world, and the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
which existed for a time beside it, only a vanishing
shadow. For this real and permanent world, then
represented by the Church, they believed Christ
to have died. The more hopeful Christians might
expect that the two worlds would yet become
identical, through the conversion of all men before
the second advent. Then Christ would come, not
in wrath, but simply in love; not to punish, but
simply to reward. This, however, could only have
been a rare belief. In general the expectation of
the Church was that Christ would come speedily,
and sweep away all men outside it, and leave it
alone on an earth renewed and glorified. Faith
in him was the pass that procured admission to
the felicities of his Messianic reign; to those outside
Christianity his coming could only bring confusion
and ruin.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>This new world, the creation of which was begun
by Christ’s death, and was to be completed by his
second coming, the early Christians regarded as a
kingdom of light girdled on every side by the old
world or kingdom of darkness. It was their mission,
they held, to extend its frontiers, and continuously
to encroach on the region given over to night.
Every inch of ground they gained they believed
to be saved from an imminent destruction. For
the fervour of proselytism which possessed them
rested on the dogma of the second advent. To it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
they looked forward as a blessing to themselves
and a terror to the rest of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> All men
outside the Church seemed to be walking on the
brink of a precipice, over which they were shortly
to be hurled. Naturally to save as many as
possible of these from a danger so immediate and
so vividly conceived was to most Christians the
chief object of life. Some of the sterner of them,
as we know from the book of Revelation, which
was written at the close of this period, expected
with gladness the coming of Christ to take vengeance
on his enemies. But the harsh and exclusive
spirit of that characteristically Jewish work
could not have been general; and we may be sure
that the Christians, as a whole, felt only pity when
they thought of the impending destruction of the
proud non-Christian world.</p>

<p>Many strange ideas entered into the expectation
of the coming of Christ. It was even thought that
at the last moment he would convert and save
those who had been unreached by his earthly
envoys. St. Paul believed that then, “after the
fulness of the Gentiles had come in,” Israel would
at length be saved.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> As to what was to follow
the second advent, opinions slightly varied. According
to St. Paul,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Christ would establish after
it an eternal and heavenly kingdom of the Christian
living and risen dead; but according to the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of Revelation,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> he would then reign for a thousand
years on earth, afterwards beginning his everlasting
rule.</p>

<p>From the new world then to be completed the
Christians believed sin to have been put away by
the death of Christ. The doctrine of the Atonement,
as they understood it, meant actual deliverance
from sin, and not mere deliverance from its
penalty. Nothing could be clearer than St. Paul’s
statement of this.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> All St. Paul’s epistles are pervaded
by a tone of grieved surprise that sin should
be found existing within the Church. Sin in his
eyes was essentially the mark of the old world.
If, then, a Christian sinned, he showed that he did
not really belong to the new world; he was under
the law, and not under grace, and by the law he
would be condemned; he would perish with the
perishing world. Probably, under the pressure of
such a belief, the Church at this time was the
purest society of men that has ever existed. Considering
the moral condition of the period, it is
likely that the distinction then made between
believer and sinner almost corresponded to actual
fact. Practically within all was good, and without
all was evil. In modern evangelical Protestantism
language of the same kind is often used, but only
as the shadowy semblance of what was once substantial
reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>The belief in the second advent of Christ in
another way must have helped to maintain the
purity of the early Christians. Living in the
constant expectation of his immediate coming,
worldly pleasures seemed too transient and unsure
to be worthy of attention. Their belief too, was
invested with a vivid sense of reality. They expected
to see their lord in all his heavenly majesty,
not under strange and unknown conditions only to
be experienced by passing through the gate of
death, but in the midst of the familiar associations
of earth. They awaited his appearance “in the
very world which is the world of all of us,” and the
shadow of his coming lay on all the thoughts and
actions of their lives.</p>

<p>With the fading of so beautiful a dream the real
corruption of Christianity began. As the years
passed by, and Christ did not appear, the hopes
of the Church gradually died away. The doctrine
of his speedy coming at length became the last
refuge of fanaticism. With it “the freshness of
the early world” of Christianity finally perished;
the Church never knew again the simplicity and
purity which marked this period of its youth.</p>

<p>The expectation of the immediate coming of
Christ was the sustaining principle of Jewish
Christianity. The loss of it threw the Church
completely into Pagan hands. While it prevailed,
Christians cared little about the explanation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
their theology; existing conditions were regarded
as too provisional. But afterwards, when a long
life seemed to lie before the Church, theological
“pseudo-science” was born. New and complex
doctrines were needed to engage the thoughts of
Christians, and these Pagan Christianity supplied.</p>

<p>Though the Christianity of this period was
thoroughly Jewish in the character of its doctrines,
the preaching of it was addressed chiefly to Pagans.
St. Paul was their representative among the heads
of the Church, and preached almost exclusively
to them. In turning to them, Christianity had to
a certain extent to adapt itself to their ideas. The
nature of this adaptation is clearly visible in the
writings of St. Paul.</p>

<p>I have said that, in preaching to Jews, the
watchwords of Christianity probably were “Jesus
and the remission of sins.” In preaching to
Pagans, these watchwords would not have been
worth much. Pagans looked for no Messiah, nor
were they likely to be inconveniently conscious
of sin. The great doctrine of the Church on which
stress was laid when it preached to Pagans, as we
have clear evidence in St. Paul’s epistles, was the
resurrection. Christianity attracted Pagans mainly
by promising them the resurrection of the dead.
This was naturally the case, as to them, unlike
Jews, it was a novel doctrine. But the strength
of Christianity in dealing with Pagans lay not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
merely in its assertion of the resurrection of the
dead, but in the proof of the resurrection it professed
to give. This, again, is plainly evident in
the epistles of St. Paul. He dwells so much on
the resurrection of Christ that we might suspect him
to have been tainted originally with the scepticism
of the Sadducees. By this peculiarity, however,
he was exactly fitted to be the apostle of the
Gentiles. With his writings before us, we may be
sure that he preached to Pagans, as he is made to
do in the Acts of the Apostles, “Jesus and the
resurrection.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> To him the resurrection of Christ
was the evidence for the general resurrection of
the dead; while his conviction that Christ had
risen from the dead rested on the belief that he
as well as others had seen Christ after his death.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
And so St. Paul could preach the resurrection to
Pagans in a very effective manner, declaring that
the dead would rise again, and giving as proof of
this the fact that one man, Jesus, was known thus
to have risen, as after his death he had been seen
by many credible witnesses, including St. Paul
himself. If God had raised Jesus, why should he
not also raise other men? Christ had risen from
the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that
slept.</p>

<p>Thus while the watchwords of the Church in
preaching to Jews were “Jesus and the remission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of sins,” its watchwords in preaching to Pagans
were “Jesus and the resurrection.” That the
evidence on which this preaching was founded
should have existed is natural enough. The
disciples of Christ, as Jews, necessarily believed
that he, after his death, had ascended to heaven,
and was living there with God. Such being the
case, there is nothing strange in their fancying
that he occasionally appeared to them.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> The
death of Christ must have immediately weeded out
of the Church all but his most faithful followers.
It is not surprising that these, in the midst of the
disturbance and excitement of those early days,
should have seen visions of their lord, should have
imagined that he came sometimes from heaven to
console them and strengthen them in their weakness.
People so superstitious, in a period of so
much supernaturalism, were almost certain to see
such visions. St. Paul’s own particular vision,
which played so important a part in the history of
early Christianity, of course can only be explained
by referring to the peculiarities of his personal
character.</p>

<p>This basing the doctrine of the resurrection of
the dead on the resurrection of Christ had nothing
to do with the subsequent belief that he rose on
earth and stayed there for a time. St. Paul
evidently believed that Christ appeared to others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
as well as to himself by coming straight from
heaven, and that his resurrection had been his
entrance into heavenly glory.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>In another and a more important respect the
influence of its Pagan proselytes affected the
principles of Jewish Christianity. In preaching
to Pagans it was necessary to determine the nature
of Christ. For Jews it was enough to call him the
Messiah; their imagination supplied the rest. But
Pagans, who had no Messianic expectations, required
an explanation of his position as founder
of the Church. This influence naturally was most
felt by St. Paul, and through him it had a considerable
effect in shaping the development of
Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>St. Paul believed that Christ “was born of the
seed of David according to the flesh, and declared
to be the son of God in power by the resurrection
from the dead.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Thus St. Paul, as Strauss says,
began the deification of Christ. Of course, as
Strauss also points out, this was due to the fact
that he had never personally seen Christ. Entering
the Church some years after its founder’s death,
when already legendary influences must have been
active in exalting him, St. Paul had no knowledge
of Christ to check his natural tendency to glorify
the master whom he believed to have appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
to him in a blaze of heavenly light. The other
Christians who saw visions of Christ had probably
all known him during his life, and this must have
interfered with their impulses to magnify him.
Naturally, then, St. Paul went further than the
other leaders of the Church, and, having seen
Christ only in a heavenly vision, thought of him
only as a heavenly being. The conception he
ultimately formed of Christ in consequence of this
tendency to exalt him is somewhat obscure. The
term “son of God” in the mouth of a Jew might
have only a vague meaning applicable to any
man. As employed by St. Paul, it evidently has
a special significance. He seems to have believed
that Christ was the true Man, Man as he ought
to be. Adam was the first and imperfect man,
Christ was the second and perfect man. Thus
God was the father of Christ in a fuller sense than
that in which he was the father of ordinary men,
as he had imparted to Christ more of his own
nature. Through this possession of elements of
the divine nature, Christ was able to represent and
redeem mankind fallen under the power of sin.
All faithful followers of him were to be made
partakers of his divine characteristics, were to
become children and heirs of God and joint-heirs
with Christ, were to suffer and be glorified with
him.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>Christ was evidently regarded by St. Paul as
made thus peculiarly the son of God by his
possession of God’s spirit. No idea of his having
had a miraculous human birth entered into this
belief. God in the fulness of time sent forth his
son in the likeness of sinful flesh, born under the
law, that he might redeem those who were under
the law.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> St. Paul, however, seems to have
believed vaguely in Christ’s pre-human existence;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
but the pre-existence he assigned to Christ was
potential rather than actual, Christ existing from
the beginning of time as the destined deliverer of
mankind.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>So the extent of St. Paul’s deification of Christ
may be thus generally described. He believed
that Christ was in a peculiar sense the son of
God—that is, something more than ordinary man.
Intermediate between God and man, he was at
once God’s agent and man’s representative. But
St. Paul clearly makes him inferior to God as well
as superior to man, and allows him no power
except what is delegated to him by God.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Thus
as yet there was no sign of the doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Incarnation, though a path for it was being prepared.
For the doctrine of the Incarnation, it
must be remembered, is not a mere deification of
Christ. It is important, not because it deifies man,
but because it humanizes God. St. Paul undoubtedly,
so far as he deified—it would be better
to say divinised—Christ, helped the Pagan tendencies
of later Christianity, but there was nothing
actually Pagan in his belief.</p>

<p>The death of St. Paul marked the beginning of
the end of Jewish Christianity. As the Jewish
leaders died off, the vast Pagan majority seized
upon power and impressed their ideas on the
doctrines of the Church. Between the undiluted
Jewish Christianity of its origin and the Pagan
Christianity of the second century, Paulinism served
as a link which enabled them finally to remain
in nominal connection. In the spurious epistles
attributed to St. Paul we can trace the steps of
advancing Paganism, and observe the struggle for
reconciliation which his followers inherited from
him. Paulinism was ultimately lost in the Paganism
with which its Jewish opponents had identified
it. But it bridged the interval between the Jewish
and Pagan periods of Christianity, and so saved
the Church from a rupture it could not have
survived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />

<small>PAGAN CHRISTIANITY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the movement within Judaism with which
hitherto we have been mainly occupied was tending
to create out of it a world-religion, outside of it circumstances
were preparing to make this tendency
succeed. The later additions to Judaism, the
supernatural system of dogma which formed the
basis of Christianity, were, as I have already said,
favourable to its expansion by reason of their harmony
with Pagan ideas. About the time at which
they entered strongly into Judaism, began a steady
break-up of the religions of the Pagan world. The
material power of Rome attacked them from below,
by destroying the national foundations on which
they rested, while Greek culture and philosophy,
advancing under the protection of that power,
assailed them from above. Under the double
pressure they faded away. In the age of the
apostles, over the greater part of the Roman empire
religion was a matter of sincere belief only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
with the lower orders of the people. A few men
of thought and learning put it utterly aside.
Between these two classes there was the great
body of ordinary persons mentioned at the beginning
of our first chapter, who had lost faith
in the popular religions, but were themselves
thoroughly religious. The credulity which always
characterizes periods of religious change, when
some form of religion is destroyed, though the
religious spirit retains its energy, was universal.
Besides this break-up of the old religions in consequence
of the extension of Roman power, in
another way that extension of power more directly
prepared a path for a great proselytising system.
As national limits were overthrown, of course a
religion that ignored national distinctions could
more easily overspread the world.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> Thus when
Christianity touched Paganism everything promised
it success. In fact, the critical period in the life of
Christianity was that which immediately followed
its founder’s death. While it existed only in
Palestine, it was in great danger. When it spread
among the synagogues of Jews in foreign countries,
it had a surer footing. And when from these,
which served as a means of introducing it to them,
it turned to Pagans, it was placed beyond possibility
of failure.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Christianity failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
to conquer the Judaism from which it sprang,
while the Paganism seemingly foreign to it everywhere
succumbed to it. A few centuries after this
time every part of the Roman empire professed
Christianity as its religion, while the Jews remained
still the same. Paganism was overcome
and absorbed by Christianity, but Judaism shook
it off as an excrescence without suffering harm.
In this fact there is nothing surprising. Judaism
was too strong for Christianity to subdue it, while
Paganism was a ready prey. The Roman empire,
outside Judaism, lay before Christianity like a body
without a mind; it needed a unifying religion to
match its political unity, and this Christianity
supplied.</p>

<p>The general effect likely to be produced on
Christianity by its reception of Pagan disciples
may now be considered. It is obvious that Pagans,
who were steeped in religious ideas very different
from those with which the Jews were familiar,
would carry with them into Jewish Christianity
different principles of religion. To ascertain the
extent of this difference, we must compare Judaism
and Paganism.</p>

<p>As a pure monotheism, Judaism stood alone in
the world. A purely monotheistic religion tends
to produce humility and stress on faith. The two
great principles of human action, which Mr. Lecky
names as the alternative forces that underlie every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
important movement of mankind,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> a sense of
human dignity and a sense of sin, are distinctive
marks of polytheism and monotheism. Monotheism,
with its one God so far removed from man,
inspires a feeling of human nothingness in comparison
with him. Polytheism, with its far more
anthropomorphic and less awful gods, does not
dwarf man thus, but enables him freely to compare
himself with the divinities he worships. And
monotheism, by making man appear nothing beside
God, necessarily exalts faith above good works
as a means of pleasing him; for when the distance
between them is so immense, the best that man
can do appears a trifle. Both these tendencies
of Judaism, as a monotheism, were more than
counterbalanced by other circumstances connected
with it. The humility the Jews might feel when
conscious of the difference between themselves and
God was more than outweighed by the pride they
felt in their superiority to the rest of mankind as
his chosen people who alone had the knowledge
of him.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Their superiority to other men naturally
affected them more than their inferiority to God.
The strict legalism of Judaism also prevented stress
on faith from being developed in it, as a multitude
of petty observances made it peculiarly a religion
of works. But both these principles were latent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Judaism, and were only checked by special circumstances
attending it as a national religion. These
circumstances being removed, the latent principles
were sure to be developed. And, in fact, in Jewish
Christianity, which was neither formal nor exclusive,
their development was unmistakable.
Early Christianity was essentially distinguished
both by humility and stress on faith, as a glance
at the New Testament is sufficient to show.</p>

<p>Simplicity of thought also characterized Judaism.
Mysticism was abhorrent to a pure Jew, though a
hellenised Jew like Philo might be steeped in it.
Simplicity of worship, too, was a feature of Judaism;
for the splendid ritual connected with the temple
at Jerusalem was not properly a part of it, but was
merely the expression of national pride. When
away from Jerusalem, the Jew worshipped in the
simplest and purest manner. And, most of all,
morality was closely bound up with Judaism.
Josephus justly boasted that his religion made
virtue an indispensable part of itself.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> The Jews
as a whole were certainly far more moral than the
Pagans as a whole.</p>

<p>The opposite of all these qualities characterised
Pagan religions. Pagans felt no religious humility,
for there was no great difference between their
gods and themselves. Pride, a sense of human
dignity, distinguished them as men. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
not to lay stress on faith, for this pride made them
fully recognize the value of their own good works.
Mysticism marked their religious thought, and
sensuousness their religious worship. Between
morality and their religions there was only the
loosest connection.</p>

<p>Keeping these facts in view, we can easily understand
the change in Christianity which now began.
All the characteristics of Judaism just mentioned
distinguished Jewish Christianity. Humility, stress
on faith, simplicity of thought and worship, and
the closest connection with morality clearly marked
the religion of the early Church. This was evidently
the case because the first Christians were
Jews. When, then, the Pagans came in, having
wrapped up in their religious ideas pride, trust in
good works, mysticism, a love of sensuous worship,
and a loose regard for morality, and when before
long they alone made up the Church, Christianity
could not remain unchanged. Christianity became
Pagan because Pagans became Christians. And
this is the full explanation of its corruption. The
Jews, in a religious sense, were more highly developed
than the Pagans, and so when it passed
from Jews to Pagans it necessarily deteriorated.</p>

<p>As Christianity was preached in the Pagan
world, it continually reached lower strata of
Paganism. At first only the best Pagans could
have entered the Church, but afterwards, as it grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in influence, Pagans of a constantly inferior type
must have joined it. Thus the corruption of Christianity
proceeded, not merely because Pagans in
larger numbers professed it, but because, as time
went by, a lower, a more Pagan class became included
within its ranks. All during the period we
are now examining probably belonged to the
great middle order of society before mentioned,
philosophers and peasants equally being absent.
Christianity clung to the cities, and the restlessness
of city life contributed to the growth of its
theology. We will now trace the results of the
direct influence of Paganism on the dogmas of the
Church.</p>

<p>This influence naturally showed itself in a tendency
towards the exaltation of Christ. He would
seem to Pagans the real god of Christianity. God,
the purely Jewish divinity, the national deity of
Judaism, must have been from the beginning unattractive
to Pagans, who disliked Jews, and were
accustomed to gods that differed but little from
men. The identification by Marcionite Gnosticism
of the Jewish god with the malignant creator of
matter showed how strong this feeling could become.
But for the most part Pagans would simply
put God aside, and fix all their attention on Christ.
They would honour and exalt him, and regard
him as the representative of heaven. Thus Paganism
must have tended to develop still further the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Christology of Paulinism. The first result of this
probably appeared in connection with the Pauline
phrase “son of God.” A Jew could not misinterpret
the phrase and give it a literal meaning,
but a Pagan might do so easily. Familiar with
ideas of extremely anthropomorphic gods, Pagans
would naturally consider Christ to be the son of
God in the sense in which Herakles was the son of
Zeus. As the proportion of Jews in the whole
number of Christians grew less, the increasing
Paganism of the Church developed this tendency,
until finally it resulted in the belief in the miraculous
conception of Christ, the first distinctly Pagan
dogma of Christianity.</p>

<p>The gospels supply us with almost certain
evidence that this was the way in which the dogma
originated. The genealogies in Matthew and
Luke are clear proof that the earlier traditions of
the Church made Joseph the father of Christ, and
of course the Church was less Pagan then than it
was in later times. The doctrine, as Dean Milman
points out, is utterly un-Jewish.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> The Jews
always expected the Messiah to be born in the
ordinary manner, and they reverenced God too
much to put him in the place of a human father.
So the dogma shows plainly that it was the first
triumph of Christian Paganism. Jewish Christianity
was only able slightly to spiritualize it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
to found it in appearance upon an absurd misinterpretation
of a passage of Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>While the beginning of the gospel narratives
was being constructed by one influence of Pagan
Christianity, the end of them was being constructed
by another. When the expectation of the second
coming of Christ was abandoned, the Church had
to assign a different meaning to his resurrection.
Originally, and especially by St. Paul, this was
closely connected with the second advent.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> St.
Paul evidently regarded the appearances of Christ
to him and to others as preliminaries of the second
advent, but now they seemed to stand in another
light. Examining the traditions which preserved
the remembrance of the visions of Christ seen by
the early Christians, the Church found them, of
course, clustered most thickly in the period immediately
after his death, when the conditions likely to
produce them were strongest. Visions seen after
that time were probably only occasional and rare,
and, with the exception of St. Paul’s, they were
sure to have little importance. Finding, then, that
nearly all the appearances of Christ had occurred
within a short period after his death, the Church
would naturally make a distinction between this
period and subsequent times. Christ obviously
seemed to have been more present then than after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>wards.
It would not be long before the belief
would follow that he had actually stayed on earth
during this period, before he had ascended to
heaven. With his second coming no longer expected,
that he should have done so would seem
quite natural. The Church having to face a long
life without Christ, it was reasonable that, before
leaving it to its lonely struggle, he should have
stayed with it for a time to sustain its immaturity
and to strengthen it for its work. A solemn ascension
of Christ in presence of his disciples would
seem to be demanded as a suitable close to this
period, and with the addition of it the dogma
was complete.</p>

<p>As we can see by comparing Luke’s gospel with
the Acts, this stay on earth was made shorter by
an earlier than it was by a later belief. It was
probably fixed finally at forty days, in order to include
different reports of visions with places other
than Jerusalem as their scene, and possibly, through
the influence of expiring Christian Judaism, to
match the forty days of Moses on Mount Sinai.
That Christ rose on the third day after his death
was a dogma of older times accepted by St. Paul,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
founded, it is likely, on a passage of Hosea,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and
there was no difficulty in connecting it with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
belief in his stay on earth. So the final doctrine
of the Church was that Christ rose again on the
third day after his death, stayed then forty days
on earth, and afterwards ascended to heaven, not
to return till the day of judgment and the end of
mortal things.</p>

<p>The evidence in favour of this explanation of
the origin of the orthodox doctrine of the resurrection
of Christ is exceptionally strong. The
accounts in the gospels, so confused and contradictory
even in comparison with the rest of them,
and telling only of occasional appearances of Christ
to his disciples, show us clearly the underlying
basis of dreams and visions on which the legend
was founded. The belief in the resurrection of
Christ on earth, we may conclude with almost
historical certainty, arose from the late combination
of the early traditions of Christ’s appearances
from heaven to his disciples.</p>

<p>Thus at the time to which we have now come
the Church in general believed Christ to be the
divinely begotten and humanly conceived son of
God, who had risen after his death on earth, and
then had finally ascended to heavenly glory.
Pagan principles had triumphed, and Paganism
was every moment growing stronger in Christianity.
The tendency to exalt Christ, already far
advanced, had now nothing to check it. Forces
were at work which were inevitably destined fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to deify Christ, to lift him to the level of the Jewish
God. The Jewish elements of Christianity,
including monotheism, were thus in great danger
of utterly perishing. Christianity, in fact, was
tending to become a purely Pagan polytheistic
religion, with a human being as its most important
god, when it was saved by the influence on it at
this critical period of a fortunate development in
Jewish hands of Pagan philosophy.</p>

<p>Philosophy, from the moment of its first existence,
has always by an irresistible pressure been
driven towards monotheism. The consciousness
in the thinker of his own unity, and the inevitable
conditions of thought, alike force him to imagine
one power as the cause of all the phenomena of
life. Philosophy, when it arises in the midst of
polytheism, at first allows the orthodox gods to be
the subordinate instruments of this power, but it
soon develops a tendency to sweep them utterly
away. Then, having shaken itself free of popular
religion, it builds up a new religion of its own, in
which it asserts the existence of one supreme intelligence,
the creator and governor of the world.</p>

<p>When philosophy has got thus far, and has constructed
its eternal God, certain difficulties confront
it. God, as the great first cause, has to be made
perfect, for if he were imperfect thought would have
to ascend higher to find a cause of his imperfection.
But as the creator of all things, God at one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
must have existed alone, an absolute being
simply self-contemplative. When he began to
create, he ceased to be absolute, and became a
relative being contemplative of his own creation.
If as an absolute being he was perfect, how did he
remain perfect when he became a relative being?
The study of this problem has generally driven
philosophy into pantheism, but where it has maintained
its hold on theism, it has been forced to
suppose that a change occurred in God at the time
of creation, by which he remained absolute in
regard to himself, though he became relative in
regard to that which he created.</p>

<p>Two Gods had thus to be imagined, one absolute
and eternal, the other relative and existing from
the beginning of created things. But these two
had to be one, or else the first or absolute God
would have been relative to the second, and so the
old difficulty would have been revived. Hence
there was need of a mystery; God was one and
yet two, two persons and one substance. The first
was God as he was through all eternity, the second
was God as he was manifested in creation, his
representative with everything but himself. Thus
the second was a mediator between the first and
the world.</p>

<p>While for purely philosophical reasons philosophy
was thus compelled to dualise God, other reasons
also impelled it to this conclusion. Holding him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
to be pure mind, it had to explain his action on
matter. Here, too, it was necessary to suppose, a
mediator between the material world and God.
And in proportion as philosophy advanced in its
theism, it extended the attributes of God and
raised him to a loftier height above created things;
and hence, to connect him with what was so far
inferior, a mediator again was needed. But in all
cases this mediator had to be a part of God himself,
or no difficulty was met; and thus in every
way philosophy tended towards a divine dualism
in mystery.</p>

<p>All Greek philosophy, except where it drifted
into pantheism or pure materialism, was more or
less influenced by this tendency. In Platonism
especially it is clearly marked. The ideal world
of Plato fills the place of the second or relative
God, and acts as a mediator between God the
absolute and the material world. God, according
to Plato, is not the creator of matter, which, so far
as it is recognized in his system, is given an eternal
existence. The action of God is confined to the
ideal world, of which material phenomena are a
distorted reflection. At the time of the beginning
of Christianity these features of Platonism were
strongly developed in the theology of an Alexandrian
Jew.</p>

<p>Outside Palestine the most important centre of
Jewish thought was Alexandria. There from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
time of the captivity a large colony of Jews had
been established. This colony became in many
respects almost independent of Jerusalem in religion;
it formed and translated its own canon of
sacred writings, and even set up a temple of its
own. Speaking the Greek language and living in
the most cosmopolitan city of the world, the meeting-ground
of eastern and western thought, the
Jews of Alexandria were naturally affected by the
speculative activity of Greek philosophy. The
high development of Judaism encouraged speculation
in its adherents. The Jewish philosopher had
not, like the Pagan, to cast his religion aside when
he began to seek out the causes of things; on the
contrary, his religion seemed to cover a great part
of the philosophical path. Under these circumstances,
it is not strange that a philosophy should
have arisen among the Alexandrian Jews.</p>

<p>For us this philosophy is represented by Philo,
who was born about twenty years before Christ.
A Jew by birth, and nominally always one in
religion, Philo was so steeped in Pagan thought
that he really ranks as a Greek philosopher. The
chief object of his life was to reconcile Judaism
and Hellenism, to give a philosophical reason for
every feature of the Jewish religion. In fulfilment
of this purpose, he handled Judaism with considerable
freedom, and bent its simple theology into
a mystical Platonism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>The tendency which inevitably characterized
philosophy to push God back from contact with
creation, and to preserve his shadowy glory as an
absolute being, of course influenced Philo, who
simply as a philosopher was bound to be a pure
theist. But as a Jew also, Philo was bound to
be a pure theist, with the most reverent conception
of God. Thus two forces acted on him, as
a Jew and as a Greek philosopher, driving him
to the most refined theism, and this double pressure
produced what Professor Huxley calls Philo’s
agnosticism. He was compelled to form a conception
of God utterly inconsistent with his character
as creator of the world. Philo could not
imagine that God had any relations with matter,
or that he contemplated anything except the
world of his own ideas. So philosophy, helped
by his monotheistic religion, forced Philo to pursue
the path of theological development which I have
described above, to leave God in his pure essence
absolute and unknown, and to attribute all the
phenomena of creation to a mediator between
this pure essence and created things.</p>

<p>In Judaism, language had already been used
which, taken literally, almost described such a
mediator. Wisdom had been spoken of as God’s
companion before creation and his assistant or
agent in all that he had done.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> In a passage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the Psalms the word of God had been called the
maker of the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Language of this kind
probably was merely the result of the inveterate
tendency of the Jewish mind to express itself by
means of personification and symbolism, and had
no mystical significance. But the passage last
referred to, derived of course from the formula
of creation in the first chapter of Genesis, seems
to have guided Philo in his difficulty. He made
the “Word” of God the required mediator, God’s
agent and representative in all his actions.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>Philo’s conception of the Word is shrouded in
the deepest mysticism. In language worthy of
the Athanasian Creed, he asserts that it is neither
created nor uncreated.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> At one time he makes
it distinct from God, at another a simple manifestation
of God. These contradictions reveal his
meaning only the more plainly. He regarded the
Word as the modification of God which necessarily
preceded creation, God the relative, while God
the absolute remained outside it and yet not
separate from it. Contradiction, of course, was
inevitable. As a monotheist, for him there could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
be but one God; as a theistic philosopher, he had
to push this God back from contact with the
world. Hence he was compelled to imagine a
manifestation of God, distinct from him and yet
mystically one with him, to bear the burden of
creation, and to represent the divine nature with
all outside itself.</p>

<p>On the theological system of Philo, which was
widely diffused at the period of its greatest danger
from the pressure of Paganism, Christianity now
drew largely to avert its ruin. This product of
Pagan mysticism was exactly what it needed at
the time. It was in danger, through its deification
of Christ, of losing its monotheism and of
worshipping a human God. By identifying Christ
with Philo’s Word, every difficulty was overcome.
The doctrine of an incarnation of a divine being
in a human form had already entered into Asiatic
religion, and, in a more familiar shape, was a
common feature of western Paganism. Christ, as
the Word made flesh, could be raised to the level
of God without destroying monotheism; the Jewish
God, as the absolute and unknown, could be reduced
to the position of a constitutional sovereign;
by a mystery the impulses of the Church could
be satisfied, and yet the purity of Christianity be
preserved.</p>

<p>“Philo,” says Professor Kuenen, “gave the
Church a formula commensurate with her ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
of her founder.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> But Philo really did much
more. He gave the Church a means of reconciling
conflicting tendencies within it, of satisfying
at once the higher and the lower class of religious
instincts. And by doing so he saved Christianity.
If this means of reconciliation had not been provided,
Christianity would have sunk to the level
of Paganism, and would have fallen among the
ruins of the empire. Still we must not conclude
that the doctrine of the mystic union of the
persons of the Trinity was, except in a secondary
sense, derived from Philo. Primarily it was derived
from the necessities of Christianity. By
deifying Christ, the Church prepared the way for
that doctrine and the dogma of the Incarnation
depending on it. Before Philonism entered into
Christianity, Christ was man made God; afterwards
he was God made man; but before and
after alike he was the object of Christian worship.</p>

<p>The Church adhered closely to the philosophical
basis of the doctrine. Christ, as the Word, was
made the sole instrument of creation, God the
relative; God the absolute, the Jewish God, was
left in lonely supremacy, unnoticed except in the
theological philosophy of Christianity. We can
see the doctrine in its early shape best in the
fourth gospel, which was written about the middle
of the first half of the second century, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
to give it a basis in the life of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> The
gospel was probably composed in Asia Minor,
where Gnosticism and the Asiatic fondness for
mystery would naturally facilitate the development
of the doctrine. “In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. All things were made by means of him,
and without him was not anything made.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> That
is, at the beginning of creation, the Word existed
with and as God, and became the agent by whom
all things were created. But of course to the
Church the Incarnation was the most important
fact. “The Word became flesh;”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Christ was
God incarnate. The Church might now safely
worship its founder. As God, the human Christ
could be adored, while nominally monotheism was
maintained.</p>

<p>It was long before the doctrine was finally
settled. Not until early in the fourth century, at
the Council of Nicæa, did the Church define the
dogma in its fulness. During this period different
opinions prevailed respecting it, until at last, on
the question of Arianism, two great parties made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
it their battle-ground. In the controversy the
orthodox contention was philosophically justifiable.
Christ, as God the relative, had to be of one
substance with God the absolute, or no absolute
God remained; while if in substance also he was
not eternal, he ceased to be God at all. Arianism,
in fact, was simply Christian rationalism; it endeavoured
to explain the relationship of God the
Father and God the Son. But the essence of the
dogma is pure inexplicable mystery, and rationalism
could not touch it without destroying it. In
the Nicene Creed it is stated in its proper form.
“I believe in one God, maker of heaven and
earth, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten
son of God, begotten of his father before
all worlds, very God of very God, begotten,
not made, being of one substance with the Father,
by whom all things were made.” Here the philosophical
basis of the dogma is shown in the
clearest manner. God was modified and Christ
produced before creation began, and by means of
Christ the work of creation was performed. We
must carefully remember that the Nicene Council
did not assert the eternal existence of Christ as
a distinct being. He existed eternally, but in God
the absolute before the creation of things. This
is declared plainly in the damnatory clauses attached
to the original creed by the Council, one
of which anathematized him who should say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Christ had not existed before he was begotten.
It was not until long afterwards, in the Athanasian
Creed, that the eternal existence of Christ as a
person of the then fully developed Trinity was
made a dogma of the Church, notwithstanding the
absurd contradiction in terms involved in its statement.
As expressed in the Nicene Creed, putting
aside the misleading words “Father” and “Son,”
inherited from an earlier belief, there is no such
direct contradiction in the doctrine. God as one
existed eternally; God as two persons only from
the beginning of things.</p>

<p>Thus the mystery of one God in two became
a part of Christianity. The Church believed in
God, and worshipped him as manifested in Christ.
The incarnation of God was henceforth the doctrine
dearest to the Christian. His God was thus
brought near to him, and presented to him in a
form he could readily grasp. And, besides, the
love felt by the Church for its founder was strengthened
by the belief that he had renounced divine
glory to come to the assistance of men. The God
who had become man in his love for men, and
for their sakes had endured suffering and shame,
inspired the passionate devotion which, in the
darkness of medieval Christianity, shone with a
blaze of light. As the figure of the human Christ
faded away in the dim distances of the past, the
figure of the divine Christ was able to replace it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and to kindle anew the flame of zeal which had
marked the beginning of the Church.</p>

<p>The second great dogma of Christianity had
now been developed. The Incarnation took its
stand beside the Atonement in the doctrines of
the Church. Henceforth Christian theology was
a mixture of Judaism and Paganism. For when
this new essentially Pagan dogma of the Incarnation
was added on, the old essentially Jewish
dogma of the Atonement had entered too deeply
into the life of Christianity to be laid aside. Both
had to be accepted by the Christian. And, unfortunately,
they happened to be utterly inconsistent.
The doctrine that Christ had borne the
penalty of human sins, and had died as an atoning
victim, did not harmonize with the doctrine that
Christ was God. That God has forgiven human
sins and laid the penalty on a victim chosen for
the purpose, is a doctrine strange indeed, but
perfectly natural when viewed from a Jewish standpoint;
but that God has forgiven human sins and
laid the penalty on himself is a doctrine which,
viewed from any standpoint, cannot be other than
a hopeless puzzle.</p>

<p>Incompatible as the two dogmas are, Christian
theologians of course have endeavoured to reconcile
them. Only one explanation of the difficulty has
been seriously offered. This is, that an absolutely
sinless victim was required to become an atone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>ment
for human sins, and that such a victim could
not be found outside the person of God himself.
A reference to Pauline Christianity at once disposes
of this explanation. Even if Christ as
merely a man could not be sinless, he might be
more than man without being actually God. From
its very beginning, the Church regarded Christ,
as the Messiah, as one greater than ordinary men,
though still thoroughly human. Long before the
dogma of the Incarnation was in existence, Christians
looked on Christ as sinless, and connected
his sinlessness with the Atonement.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> Nevertheless,
the explanation is the best available. It has
created the doctrine of the “contract in the council
of the Trinity,” as Mr. Arnold calls it. God the
Father’s sense of justice could be satisfied only by
the self-sacrificing love of God the Son, and hence
the death of Christ upon the cross. It is certainly a
characteristic example of a theological explanation.</p>

<p>The two great dogmas remained really irreconcilable.
The Jewish dogma of the Atonement
and the Pagan dogma of the Incarnation entered
into Christianity as the results of opposite religious
tendencies, and they could never be brought into
harmony. The inevitable attempt to reconcile
them is chiefly responsible for the formation of
the complex mass of theology which so greatly
distinguishes Christianity. One or the other can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
strongly influence individual Christians, but it is
impossible for both at once to occupy the same
mind.</p>

<p>Now that we have examined the chief consequences
of the transition from Jewish to Pagan
Christianity, and dealt with the greater part of the
doctrine of the Trinity, we must investigate the
means by which that doctrine was completed by
the inclusion of the third person, the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Throughout the earlier books of the New Testament
we find constant references to the Spirit as a
presence abiding with the Church. As used most
frequently, the term simply means inspiration, the
influence of God on individual Christians. This
sense was derived directly from the Old Testament.
Jahveh’s messengers to his people are there often
described as filled with his spirit, as inspired by
him for their mission. Naturally the early Church
believed that this inspiration was continued under
the new dispensation, and that the apostles, its
leaders, were filled with the spirit of God to enable
them to perform their work. But a new feature
was introduced into the belief; the Church held
that not merely leading Christians but all Christians
were thus filled with the spirit of God. This was
the natural consequence of the Messianic prophecies.
Among the glories of the Messianic times, the
prophets often included, as the result of the reconciliation
of Jahveh and Israel, the resting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
inspiration of God on all his people, all being his
servants just as they were themselves. Of course
the early Jewish Christians applied these prophecies
to themselves, and believed that the spirit of God
rested on all the people of his true Israel, the
Christian Church.</p>

<p>But in the early books of the New Testament
we also find the term “spirit” used in a sense
applicable only to a distinct being. St. Paul, in
a remarkable passage, speaks of the Spirit as interceding
with God for man.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> In order to understand
the origin of this belief of the early Church that
the spirit of God, as a distinct being, sustained it
in its struggle with the world, it must be remembered
that the Jewish Christians regarded Christianity
as a movement from among the unconverted
Jews similar to the movement of ancient Israel
from among the Egyptians. They continually
looked for analogies between their circumstances
and what was related of the exodus from Egypt.
An angel was believed to have led the Israelites
against their enemies,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> and the Church would
naturally expect a corresponding representative of
God to watch over its progress. But by the
prophets the name “spirit” had been given to
this angel;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> and so the early Christians, believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
that the spirit of God rested on the Church, personified
it vaguely and made it a divine representative
abiding continually with them. They
regarded it as the substitute for the personal
presence of Christ which had come to them immediately
after his death. And thus the belief in the
Holy Spirit was connected with the expectation
of the second advent; it had come when Christ
had left the Church, and when he returned its
mission would be ended.</p>

<p>When the expectation of the second advent was
abandoned, and a stay on earth after his death
was assigned to Christ, the Church’s ideas of the
Spirit underwent a further development. As it
was the substitute for his presence, it could only
have come after his ascension. Just as the ascension
had been imagined as a suitable close of Christ’s
stay on earth, so now a solemn ceremony was
imagined to mark the entrance of the Spirit on
its mission. The day of Pentecost, the recognized
anniversary of the delivery of the law on Mount
Sinai, appeared the fittest time for this ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
As the founding of the law was regarded as the
true beginning of the life of Israel, the coming of
the Spirit seemed to match it and to form the true
beginning of the life of the Christian Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
The construction of this tradition, as we have it
in the Acts of the Apostles, was one of the last
results of the influence of Judaism on Christianity.</p>

<p>At about the same time this influence was shown
in another doctrine in connection with the belief
in the Holy Spirit. I have already said that, when
the mainly Pagan dogma of the miraculous conception
of Christ was created, Jewish Christianity
was able slightly to spiritualize it. By making
the Spirit the agent on the divine side of that
conception, the dogma was as far as possible
purified from its taint of grossness.</p>

<p>Until after the time of the Nicene Council, the
general belief in the Holy Spirit remained in this
vague undefined form. The Church regarded it
as a personified influence, and gave it little attention.
In the Nicene Creed there is no dogma of
the Trinity; only two persons of the Trinity as
yet existed. In the fully developed Creed merely
vague language is applied to the Spirit; it is spoken
of as a distinct being, but its union with the
Father and the Son is not asserted. The phrase,
“Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son,”
shows, as Feuerbach points out,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> how loose an idea
of personality was attached to it, and is very
different from the precise terms in which the Creed
defines the production of the Son. The subsequent
dispute between the Eastern and Western Churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
in reference to the “filioque” of the Latin form
of this Creed rendered it impossible for Christian
theology to remain satisfied with the Nicene
definition of the Spirit. Always regarded as
divine, there was now a natural tendency to declare
it to be God. A mystery of three in one was a
puzzle no more perplexing than a mystery of two
in one. And so the Holy Spirit was included in
the divine Government, and the dogma of the
Trinity was complete.</p>

<p>The full doctrine of the Trinity, philosophically
expressed, is this. God the Father is God the
absolute, incomprehensible and unapproachable by
created things. God the Son is part of God the
relative, the creator and saviour of the world. God
the Holy Spirit is the rest of God the relative, the
sustainer and guide of the world. Thus it is
evident that the third person of the Trinity philosophically
has no existence; its functions are only
carved out of those of the second. And this
philosophical non-existence of the third person has
its reflection in theology. In spite of the Athanasian
Creed, the Holy Spirit is only a shadow in
Christian belief. Intellectually the sincere Christian
is convinced of the existence of God the
Father; emotionally he is convinced of the existence
of God the Son; but of the existence of God
the Holy Spirit he is not convinced at all, and he
asserts it merely in the empty forms of traditional
dogma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>We have now dealt with all the chief dogmas of
Christianity. The Atonement, the Incarnation,
the full doctrine of the Trinity, and the more important
of the circumstances believed to be connected
with the life and death of Christ—in fact, all
the dogmas of the Creeds, have passed under our
review. Only minor doctrines, in regard to which
there are differences of opinion among Christians,
remain to be noticed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />

<small>CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the time of the completion of the doctrine
of the Incarnation, Christianity steadily advanced
towards Paganism. Gradually all the characteristics
of polytheism crept into the Church.
Idolatry, embodied specially in an important
doctrine to be mentioned presently, was embodied
generally in the worship of images. The great
principle of local government in religion which
distinguished Pagan polytheism became Christian
by the worship of saints. This was soon the chief
feature of ordinary Christianity. To the average
Christian the local saint appeared the representative
of heaven, the appointed agent through whom
heavenly blessings were to be obtained. The
Christian doctrine of the soul’s immortality,
originally derived from Judaism, was Paganised
into a resemblance to the ideas on the subject
which had vaguely entered into most forms of
Paganism. The old belief of the Jewish Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
that dead Christians “slept” until the resurrection
had become heretical by the middle of the third
century.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The doctrine of purgatorial penance
was introduced into Christianity. For this, indeed,
quite apart from Pagan influence, there was a very
good reason. In the early days of the Church,
with the moral influence of Judaism still strong on
it, and the danger of persecution keeping it pure
from unworthy members, probably almost all
Christians were fairly good. Being good, they
were fit for heaven or the heavenly reign of Christ;
and so there was no difficulty in making the
simple acceptance of Christianity the test of salvation.
But when the Church became popular, and
especially when it became the acknowledged religious
system of the empire, it was plain that a
large proportion of its members were by no means
fit for heaven. And yet, with its looser Pagan
hold on morality, it did not care to consign to
damnation faithful believers in its doctrines. The
old ideas, latent generally in Paganism, and given
special expression in the mysteries, of penal purification
from evil exactly met the difficulty, and
accordingly they were incorporated in Christianity.
As before in the case of the Incarnation, it was
the need of the Church that really created the
doctrine; Paganism only determined its form.</p>

<p>Christianity took all its supernaturalism of evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
from Judaism, that is, from the later developments
of Judaism, with hardly the slightest change. The
belief in a chief devil, having subordinates under
him, in hell or some such kind of irrevocable
punishment, characterized late Judaism as much as
Christianity. In general, this supernaturalism of
evil was less strongly developed in Pagan religions,
or rather, to speak more precisely, it was a feature
of eastern far more than of western theology.
Still Christian Paganism, though mainly western,
had no difficulty in accepting it, and it afterwards
became the chief support of medieval superstition.</p>

<p>The decline and final ruin of the empire of
Rome transformed the outward structure of Christianity.
The empire died under the hands of
northern barbarians, but it attained a resurrection
in the shape of the Papal Church. After the
separation of the Eastern and Western Churches,
the line of Christian development passed through
the latter alone, the former remaining stagnant in
consequence of its union with political despotism.
The free Church of the west, becoming the real
representative of Christianity, gradually embodied
in itself all the attributes of imperial power. The
Pope succeeded the Emperor; bishops succeeded
the provincial legates; the religious tyranny of
Catholicism succeeded the political tyranny of
Cesarism. The pomp and ceremonial of the
empire were transferred to the Church. The spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of sensuous worship latent always in Christian
Paganism of course was encouraged by this, and
expressed itself in a complex ritual. But most of
all Catholic imperialism exalted the clergy above
the laity.</p>

<p>This exaltation of the clergy was the direct
result of the transference of the imperial power to
the Church. The long reign of despotism in the
empire had unfitted the people of it for any
approach to freedom. Just as formerly they had
submitted to the material power which had had its
centre in Rome, so now they submitted to the
spiritual power which had its centre in Rome.
Only by the slow training of many centuries was
part of the population of Europe prepared for resistance
to clerical tyranny. The Reformation
rested on the political development of the peoples
among whom it was successful. The clergy were
the guardians, for good or for evil, of the childhood
of the modern world.</p>

<p>The complicated system of sacraments which
now arose in Christianity was largely the expression
of priestly power. The distinction made
between clergy and laity in the celebration of the
Eucharist showed this in its clearest form. But
most of all the power of absolution gave the priest
an unlimited supremacy. Holding the keys of
heaven and of hell, he was the master of the
Christian’s soul. The foundation of this doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
as well as that of the general recognition of an
authority peculiar to the clergy, was laid in the
willing reverence felt by the early Church for the
apostles, for the men who had actually seen its
founder. Clerical despotism cannot be ascribed to
the spirit of Paganism as distinguished from the
spirit of Judaism. But still, in its extreme development
under the pressure of changes in the Pagan
world, it was a Pagan feature of Christianity.</p>

<p>A most important distinctly Pagan doctrine was
connected with this idea of clerical sanctity. I
have already referred to the belief of the early
Church that the body and blood of Christ were
really present in the elements of the Eucharist.
It is quite clear from the language of St. Paul that
this belief in the real presence was not a belief that
the elements were actually changed into Christ’s
body and blood.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> By the faith of the communicant
the sacrament was accomplished, and without faith
it had no existence. The Eucharist was evidently
then regarded as a constantly recurring sacrament
of the once offered sacrifice of Christ’s death,
which it commemorated and declared until he
came again. That this was an exceedingly delicate
doctrine which could be easily misinterpreted
is obvious. It naturally developed into a grosser
form when Paganism, with its leaning towards
idolatry, became paramount in the Church. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
elements were then formally consecrated, and were
regarded as the actual flesh and blood of Christ.
As his body, they were laid on the altar and made
an object of worship. This, of course, was simple
idolatry. United with the dogma of the Incarnation,
it enabled the Christian to adore God as
visibly present in a material shape. The doctrine
was connected with the exaltation of the clergy,
as the power of consecration was confined to them.
Thus the sacrament of the Eucharist became the
sacrifice of the mass. The elements being actually
changed into his flesh and blood, Christ was again
made a victim; his sacrificial death was repeated
as often as the ceremony; and so the Jewish
dogma of the Atonement was linked with ideas
utterly antagonistic to Judaism.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>The deification of the Virgin Mary was another
wholly Pagan development of Christianity. Female
divinities were common in Pagan polytheism, and
female saints replaced them in Christian Paganism.
After Christ, as man, had been made the God of
Christianity, this tendency to give both sexes
divine representatives produced the exaltation of
the Virgin as his female correlative. She became
the goddess of Christianity, the real third person
of the Trinity, as Feuerbach calls her.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> As mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and wife of God, she satisfied the human instincts
of Pagan religion; and so the Church ultimately
put all heavenly power into her hands. The
asceticism of later Christianity at the same time
created the dogma of her perpetual virginity. At
last, as a divine being, she was encircled with an
atmosphere of miraculous privilege even from
before her birth.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of Pagan Christianity,
monasticism, was due to a variety of causes. In
part it had its origin in the personal character
of Christ. His insistence on inward purity was
not far removed from asceticism. But though
monastic asceticism may have had some of its
roots in later developments of Judaism, it was
foreign to Judaism as a whole. Judaism was
remarkable for its clearness and balance; it pushed
nothing too far. Monasticism in reality was chiefly
derived from eastern Paganism, from the tendency
towards asceticism so common in Oriental religions.
The same tendency produced another
important effect on western Christianity, namely,
the celibacy of the regular clergy. When this
became an accepted doctrine, the finishing touch
was given to clerical power. Henceforth the
Roman Church was the most highly organized
ecclesiastical system the world has ever seen. With
no recognized interests outside his calling, every
priest belonged body and soul to a vast dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>ciplined
mass which moved and acted like one
man.</p>

<p>Thus highly organized, the Church plunged into
the darkest period of the Middle Ages. For the
evils of this period Christianity cannot fairly be
held responsible, except in so far as it contributed
to the ruin of the Roman empire. Throughout
it, on the whole, the Church was a centre of light,
keeping alive the embers of civilization, and softening
the barbarous tendencies of the time. But in
passing through it Christianity suffered fearfully.
The ignorance and harshness and corruption of
the age were stamped ineffaceably upon it. And
this was inevitable. In every civilized country at
almost every time there are sure to be two forms
of the general religion, one popular, the other
that of the more educated classes. The popular
religion, resting on ignorance, is always a mere
superstition; the other religion, kept clear by
partial knowledge from offensive crudities, is the
recognized form. But during the worst period of
the Middle Ages there was no such distinction;
all religion was popular; even the highest classes
were hopelessly lost in superstition. The gloom
of this superstition, the shadow of the wretchedness
of the age, left a lasting mark on Christianity.
The terror of life was transferred to death; death
was associated with the most repulsive images, and
closely connected with hell. The fear of hell be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>came
the motive power of religion; to escape hell
was to the Christian the end of life.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> The superstitious
elements from which Christianity is now
struggling to release itself were mainly developed
in its passage through this period.</p>

<p>During it the moral corruption of Christianity
was enormous. The Church laid stress, not on
righteous conduct, but on orthodox thinking.
Heresy was irremediably damnable, but crimes
and sins could be easily compounded for. The
immorality of the clergy, due partly to the general
corruption of the time, and partly to their legal
celibacy, was closely connected with the toleration
of sin shown in the action of the Church. Rotten
itself, the ecclesiastical power was ever ready, in
return for material benefits, to open the gates of
heaven to secular sinners. The whole course of
medieval Christianity was a progress towards the
doctrine of indulgences which immediately provoked
the Reformation.</p>

<p>The moral decline of Christianity was the mark
of its progress towards Paganism. It receded
further from its original basis in Judaism as its
dogmas became more complex and its hold on
morality more uncertain. The complexity of
doctrine encouraged the decline in morality, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>ligious
attention being drawn by it from practical
conduct to the consideration of nice points of
theology. A reaction against this tendency was
inevitable. Christianity had shared in the descent
of European civilization, and when European
civilization began to ascend, Christianity had to
ascend along with it. But the reaction, as it
was against a corruption which was inextricably
linked with the Paganism of the Church, could
not fail to oppose itself to Paganism, that is,
to recoil back to Judaism. And this is the explanation
of the Reformation. It was the revival
of Judaism in Christianity. As the revival of
Jewish Christianity, it was sure to occur sooner
or later; once the thought and knowledge of
Europe awakened from their medieval slumber,
the revolt against Paganism was bound to begin.
The renewal of intellectual life involved the renewal
of moral life. The restored conscience of
Europe would protest first against the later corruptions
of Pagan Christianity; but these were
inseparably connected with earlier ones, and so
step by step reformers would have to ascend
along the line, until at last they would find
themselves the champions of Jewish Christianity,
contending against the forces of Paganism.</p>

<p>Thus the great schism which the Reformation
caused in Christianity was inevitable from the
first. Paganism could not be eradicated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
revival of Judaism. The more ignorant and backward
races were sure to cling to it in opposition
to the progressive spirit which revolted from it.
The schism in Christianity was as inevitable as
the schism which it occasioned in Judaism, the
necessity of which was shown in our second
chapter. And just as the expansion of Judaism
which Christ made a practical success was in its
main features quite independent of the influence
of his personal character, so the main features
of the Reformation were determined apart from
the personal influence of the Reformers.</p>

<p>From the time of the Reformation Jewish and
Pagan Christianity stood side by side. Protestantism
revived the principles of the early Church;
Catholicism retained the principles of Paganism.
Within the lifetime of Luther the change was
accomplished. He himself, because he assailed one
immoral doctrine of the corrupt Roman Church,
was forced to travel back along fourteen centuries
of religious development.</p>

<p>Of course Protestantism cannot be exactly the
same as the religion of the Jewish Church. Just
as Pagan Christianity was compelled to retain
Jewish dogmas, so Protestantism was compelled
to retain Pagan dogmas. It had nothing to rest
on except the Canon of Scripture, and part of
the New Testament is Pagan in spirit. Accordingly,
the dogmas of earlier Paganism, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
were developed while it was still mixed with
Judaism in the Church, were preserved in Protestantism.
It kept, for instance, the great Pagan
dogma of the Incarnation. Still, so far as general
principle is concerned, Protestantism fairly represents
Judaism, and Catholicism Paganism in Christianity.
This is evident if they are fully compared
with each other.</p>

<p>The Pagan character of Catholicism has already
been shown. As Catholicism—and this term
covers more than the Roman Church—has retained
all the doctrines which we have examined
as representative of Paganism in Christianity, this
is obvious. Similarly the non-Pagan character of
Protestantism is clear from its rejection of all the
later of these doctrines, from the worship of saints
to the immaculate conception. Its Jewish character
must be shown by a reference to the principles
of our comparison of Judaism and Paganism.</p>

<p>The chief distinctive doctrine of Protestantism
is justification by faith alone. That in this it
resembles Jewish Christianity, a glance at St.
Paul’s epistles is sufficient to show. It is also
plain that this doctrine is closely connected with
the great Jewish dogma of the Atonement. According
to it, sins are washed away by the blood
of Christ, the victim offered to God. But the
benefits of the sacrifice are obtained solely by
faith; the merits of the Christian cannot enhance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
its value. Still more closely, however, is the
doctrine connected with the feature distinctive of
Protestantism as of Judaism, its loftier conception
of God. This, as was pointed out in our last
chapter, is the peculiarity of monotheism, and it
shows the monotheistic character of Protestantism.
Catholicism, having inherited polytheistic ideas
from Paganism, naturally recognizes the value of
man’s good works. In the saints whom he worships
the Catholic sees beings who, though they
were once fallible like himself, have yet obtained
heavenly authority; and, as he is thus conscious
of no important difference between his divinities
and himself, he is not disposed to underestimate
the worth of his virtue.</p>

<p>As a necessary consequence of its distinctive
doctrine, Protestantism is characterized by humility.
It depresses human excellence and heightens the
sense of sin. In this it develops what were, as we
saw before, the essential tendencies of Judaism.
And, curiously enough, the phenomenon which
appeared in Judaism—theological humility more
than counterbalanced by exclusive pride—appears
also in the extreme forms of Protestantism. The
religion of the Puritans was ultra-Protestant in its
insistence on the utter sinfulness of human nature
and the need of faith; and yet no class of men
were ever prouder than they. Like the Jews, they
felt their pride as the people, the elect of God, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
were honoured by him above the rest of mankind.
The same phenomenon can be observed at the
present day among the extreme Evangelical sects
which keep the far frontier of Protestantism. In
them we also find theoretically religious humility,
and practically the most intense religious pride.
And, indeed, both in these sects and in Puritanism
we see Protestantism fully developed in its likeness
to its parent Judaism, with the harshness and
exclusiveness of Judaism thinly veiled under a
nominal Christianity.</p>

<p>Again, Protestantism resembles Judaism in its
higher morality. Protestants as a whole are certainly
more moral than Catholics as a whole. At
first sight this seems remarkable, as morality is not
encouraged by the Protestant doctrine of justification
by faith alone. But, as a matter of fact, the
priestly absolution of Catholicism is a much more
immoral doctrine. In practice, as might be expected,
the belief in justification by faith alone
does less mischief than the belief that sins can be
got rid of by a visit to the nearest church. Of
course, in addition to this, the higher theology of
Protestantism favours morality, just as the higher
theology of Judaism did. So far as it is purer and
more rational than Catholicism, it naturally is more
moral, and allies itself less easily with ignorance
and animalism.</p>

<p>Protestantism, too, is like Judaism in having for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
its basis a written revelation. The Bible is to
Protestants what the law and the prophets were to
Jews. This feature of Protestantism is obviously
connected with its depreciation of human excellence.
It makes men simply vessels for the
reception of a finished system of religious truth.
Catholicism, on the other hand, by its assertion of
a continuously inspired Church, which in every
generation may develop new dogmas, plainly
assigns a higher position in religion to man.</p>

<p>As regards simplicity of thought and worship,
there is clearly the same opposition between Protestantism
and Catholicism that there was between
Judaism and Paganism. Catholicism is remarkable
more than Protestantism for complexity of doctrine
and sensuousness in worship. We will now consider
how far this opposition shows itself in their
treatment of the great dogmas which nominally
are common to them both.</p>

<p>The Atonement being the chief Jewish dogma of
Christianity, we should expect it to be more prominent
in Protestantism than in Catholicism. And
this is strictly the case. Catholicism lays no stress
on the doctrine. In a very able work by Mr. S.
Baring-Gould, which presents the religion of Catholicism
in its truest form, the Atonement is made
simply symbolical, and the death of Christ is
regarded as hardly necessary to his work.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Protes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>tantism,
on the other hand, makes the Atonement
its primary dogma. “The blood of Jesus,” is its
central cry. It links the dogma with its distinctive
doctrine; justification by faith in the reconciling
death of Christ is the essence of its theology, and
sums up its multitudinous preaching.</p>

<p>We also find the great Pagan dogma of Christianity,
the Incarnation, more prominent in Catholicism
than in Protestantism. That God became
man is the central assertion of Catholicism, on
which it bases its higher estimation of human
dignity. This can plainly be seen in the work last
referred to, where the Incarnation is regarded as
the condition of theistic religion.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> But it is still
more evident in the tendency of Catholic theology
to exalt the divinity at the expense of the humanity
of Christ, for manifestly the doctrine of the Incarnation
is expanded and made more important in
proportion as the difference between it and the
original Jewish belief in the simple humanity of
Christ is increased. The Athanasian Creed is
thoroughly Catholic, and its definition of the
nature of Christ involves the destruction of his
human personality. Catholic theologians have
boldly adopted this conclusion, and assert that his
personality is wholly divine.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Instinctively the
Catholic always thinks of Christ as God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>Protestantism, on the contrary, never dwells on
the Incarnation. The extreme Evangelical sects,
in which its principles are fully developed, are
perpetually drifting towards Unitarianism. But,
as in the case of Catholicism, its interpretation of
the doctrine best reveals its tendencies. It exalts
the humanity at the expense of the divinity of
Christ. It holds him up as an example in a
manner which implies his human personality.
Instinctively the Protestant always thinks of Christ
as man.</p>

<p>In their treatment of the Eucharist the respective
characteristics of Catholicism and Protestantism
are also evident. We have already seen the
Paganism of the Catholic doctrine of the real
presence. Equally the two Protestant doctrines
show the influence of Judaism on Christianity.
The first, the Evangelical doctrine, which allows
the Eucharist no sacramental value, and makes it
simply a commemoration of the sacrament which
accompanied the sacrifice of Christ’s death, was
probably the belief of the Jewish Church at its
very beginning; the second, and more general one,
which asserts the real presence, but only in a
spiritual sense through the faith of the communicant,
we know to have been the belief of the later
Jewish Church in the time of St. Paul. If it were
not for the pressure of Catholicism, it is likely that
the second would be the doctrine of all forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Protestantism. But when Catholics have so exaggerated
the real presence, Protestants, by a
natural reaction, are tempted to deny it altogether.</p>

<p>Thus the two systems of religion which Christianity
seemed to unite have plainly parted again.
The Judaism in which it was born, and the Paganism
in which it reached its maturity, stand once
more side by side. And not merely does Christianity
reveal so manifestly that great opposing
forces met in its history, but in reality every
important feature of the long course of development
which has been the subject of our survey, is
recorded as clearly in its present structure as the
chief conditions of the past evolution which has
produced it are recorded in the structure of an
animal organism.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<small>THE PERMANENCE OF DOGMATIC RELIGION.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of our inquiry, one fact has been
made strikingly manifest, namely, the persistence
of religious ideas. We found that Christianity at
its beginning was only the result of a tendency
long latent in Judaism, that its doctrines were
wholly Jewish while its adherents were chiefly
Jews, and that afterwards, when Pagans in large
numbers entered the Church, they carried with
them and made Christian the principles of their
Pagan religions. Similarly we saw that no new
religion was created by the Reformation, that it
was merely an instance of reversion, of the falling
back of part of Christianity to an older type. In
fact, from our study of this subject, we might
conclude that religious ideas are practically indestructible,
or, at least, that they can only be
modified by gradual processes working during long
periods of time.</p>

<p>This conclusion would be unquestionably correct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and it especially needs to be insisted on at the
present moment. A conviction is general among
enlightened men that we are on the threshold of a
great religious revolution, which is to be effected by
the speedy destruction of Christianity and the consequent
abolition of supernatural religion. There
seems to be some reason for this belief. Within
the last half-century Christianity has declined considerably.
Thought and culture have broken loose
from it. Fifty years ago the vast majority of the
men of letters and science of Europe professed
some form of it; now only a small minority do so,
and even this minority is steadily growing smaller.
We might predict with almost absolute certainty
that fifty years hence hardly a single believer in
dogmatic Christianity will be found among the
leading men of European literature and science.
Christianity is dying at the top.</p>

<p>There is a certain resemblance between this
state of things and the condition of the Roman
world at the time Christianity was beginning to
conquer it. Pagan religions then were dying at
the top. Philosophers despised them and wits
laughed at them; the thought of the age was as
completely agnostic as the thought of our own
day is tending to become. A thinker, studying
the phenomena of the period, might then have
reasonably concluded that supernatural religion
was destined speedily to perish, that, as men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
learning had abandoned it, after a short time their
views would spread downwards, and be adopted
by all classes of the people. How exquisitely this
conclusion would have been exposed by the irony
of history! Ten centuries later the religious ideas
then current among the populace were common
to every class, and the descendants and representatives
of the philosophers who rejected super-naturalism
were employing their philosophical
powers in determining exactly the nature of angels.
Perhaps the future is preparing a similar exposure
for the philosophers of our own day, who are
confident that supernatural religion will soon be
a curiosity of the past. A few centuries hence,
if esoteric Buddhism shall take the place of
Christianity, perhaps philosophy will be engaged
in explaining the meaning of “karma,” and science
will be occupied in ascertaining the exact nature
of an astral body.</p>

<p>Supernaturalism has just as much vitality now
as it had a century after Christ. Even if within
the next few hundred years Christianity were to
become wholly extinct, the ideas underlying it
would simply be transferred to some other form
of dogmatic religion. The decline of Christianity
now, like the decline of the Paganism of the
Roman empire, so far as it is real, is the prelude
to the formation of new religions. If the support
to which the religious ideas of a generation have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
attached themselves is overthrown, they soon find
another system to sustain them. The fall of an
old religion is the signal for the rise of a new.</p>

<p>Signs of this transfer of religious allegiance are
distinctly visible at present. There is the same
mixture of credulity and scepticism now that
there was in the first century of the Christian era.
We, too, have a philosophical class intensely
sceptical, but we also have a class of people who
are eager votaries of new religions and excessively
credulous. The credulity of the many is the
consequence of the scepticism of the few, and is
the mark of religious change. It now characterizes
those whose faith in Christianity is shaken, but
in whom religious ideas are as strong as ever.</p>

<p>The religious ideas now embodied in Christianity
and stamped on the general mass of mankind
come under the head of dogmatic supernaturalism;
they are most of them concerned with God,
personal immortality, heaven, and hell. This
dogmatic supernaturalism began with the earliest
illusions which created religion thousands of years
ago. Since then, with every step of his upward
progress, man has been more and more the slave
of religious dogma. The higher religions of
historical times have multiplied assertions about
unknown phenomena; Christianity, the highest
of religions, has done so most of all. Having
inherited, then, this vast inheritance of belief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
supernatural dogma, which began to accumulate
in the remotest ages, and has since been enlarged
and made sure by the great religion which for
fifteen hundred years has been identified with
the main civilization of the world, how can men
of our own day lightly shake off supernaturalism!
A few here and there, as variations from the
general type necessarily limited in number, may
manage to put it aside after a severe contest
with the irrational instincts which they have
inherited. But so far as the mass of mankind
are concerned, ages must elapse before the work
of ages can be undone.</p>

<p>Just as in the first century the disbelief of
philosophers had discredited the Pagan religions,
so now the disbelief of men of thought is discrediting
Christianity. And as a certain class of
Pagans then turned from the discredited religions
to find another basis for their religious ideas, so
now a certain class of people are seeking a basis
for their religious ideas apparently surer than discredited
Christianity. There is a difference of
degree between the two periods; Christianity is
not yet as much discredited as the Pagan religions
were when it attacked them. We have not yet
reached the condition of the time when the
mysteries were the last props of Paganism, and
the importation of foreign religions was one of
the recognized industries of Rome. But the seeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of the development of such phenomena are plainly
visible. Spiritualism and the Psychical Research
Society are the rudiments of Christian mysteries,
and certainly attempts on a small scale are being
made to import religions into London from Syria
and India.</p>

<p>Here in England between the large class of those
who still believe in Christianity and the small class
of those who put the supernatural wholly aside lies
the class, continually increasing in numbers, of
those who have lost faith in Christianity, but have
not lost faith in the ideas which form the essence
of it. Books like “Esoteric Buddhism” and Mr.
Laurance Oliphant’s “Sympneumata” are written
for and by members of this class. The absurd
weakness of such attempts to give the supernatural
a natural basis does not in the least detract from
their popular power.</p>

<p>Life is full of inevitable illusions, and only a few
are in a position to detect their illusive character.
In regard to these illusions, the belief of the great
majority of mankind must be determined by
authority; they can only choose between alternative
authorities. And their choice cannot rest
on strong grounds of personal conviction. The
class of people just mentioned, for instance, who
have lost faith in Christianity, for the most part
could give but poor reasons for their refusal to
accept its dogmas. They simply feel that it is dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>credited,
and they do not like to be on the losing
side. Any system which embodies their religious
ideas, and does not appear to be discredited, they
will believe in readily, even though it has not a
particle of evidence to support it.</p>

<p>Moreover, when men in general have to choose
between authorities whose real weight they are not
in a position to determine, their wishes naturally
affect their choice. If one alternative is pleasanter
than the other, they are sure to decide in its favour.
Take, for instance, the belief in personal immortality.
This rests on an illusion which can be
seen through only by the exercise of a certain
amount of philosophical imagination, namely, the
impossibility of conceiving its own extinction
inherent in the mind’s consciousness of life. As
every one wishes to be immortal, that is, shrinks
from the return to his pre-natal non-existence;
and as nearly every one, besides, has lost some
loved relative or friend whose death he cannot bear
to think of as a final effacement, most people are
quite ready to accept this illusion as valid evidence
of the truth of the belief. Thus a religious system
which asserts the immortality of the soul so far has
mankind on its side. And the long influence of
Christianity, which from the beginning has been
built on the doctrine of personal immortality, has
of course co-operated with its primary attractiveness
in stamping it deeply on the nature of men of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
times. Life seems unbearable to many people unless
it is assumed to be true. It is a prominent
feature of all our new religious growths. The
Psychical Research Society seeks to confirm it by
the evidence of ghost-stories. Many generations
will have to pass away before mankind in general
can renounce it, and till then, if only to supply it
with an apparent basis, dogmatic religion must
survive.</p>

<p>If the decline of Christianity continues with the
rapidity of the last half-century, a perilous crisis
lies before the population of the civilized world.
Old religious ideas seeking a new basis will produce
new upheavals of religious imagination, and
a period of intense superstition will ensue. Whatever
might result from such a period, in itself it
could be nothing but evil, a time of darkness and
disquiet, of relaxed morality and charlatan prophets.
Fortunately the fall of Christianity is not
likely to be so rapid in the future; the great mass
of mankind may cling to it long after it has parted
from the world’s intellectual life.</p>

<p>The religion of the future certainly will not be
the curious system of Comte. Positivism is only
a philosophy masquerading in the garb of a
religion. Its fundamental principle is hopelessly
at variance with the craving for supernatural
dogma which has possession of ordinary men.
Equally, of course, a refined Christianity, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
juice of dogma squeezed out, cannot become the
religion of mankind. Religious ideas need a dogmatic
system, and in some form or other their need
is sure to be supplied.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is probable that dogmatic religion will
always be a phenomenon of human life. Man
framed it in the beginning, and man is likely to
preserve it to the end. The conditions of existence
secure it an assured tenure. The actual business
of living must occupy all the thoughts of the vast
majority of men. In regard to the matters which
lie beyond this they can only walk by faith, and
the illusions of life furnish ample material for faith
to work on. A few may have the leisure to examine
phenomena themselves, and thus may attain
freedom from the influence of illusion, and may see
things as they really are. But they can never be
more than an infinitesimal minority. And so, from
generation to generation, with the shadows of their
hopes and fears, their loves and hates, men will
people the impenetrable darkness which closes
around the mystery of life.</p>

naturally conceived God as working like a despot by simply issuing

Church, it is obvious that this need would ensure its immediate

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
